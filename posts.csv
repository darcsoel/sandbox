1,2017-02-24T00:00:00.000Z,Extensive Breach at Intl Airport,extensive-breach-at-intl-airport,post_2640f3c5ac27a8a02f155088d11762ec.png,58b0418af6069dec3a951054,Chris Vickery ,0,2017-08-11T09:20:00.059Z,2017-02-24T15:39:42.860Z,https://mackeeper.com/blog/post/334-extensive-breach-at-intl-airport,0,Extensive Breach at Intl Airport,,,"<p dir=""ltr"">The leaky data set includes everything from sensitive TSA letters of investigation to employee social security numbers, network passwords, and 107 gigabytes of email correspondence. Until I notified the facility&rsquo;s management this past Tuesday, there existed a real risk to the security and safety of this US airport.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/367cf5193ec77a84736f5da7045d822758affa6d7085b.png"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">This is an important case study in how business practices can result in data breaches. According to the materials present, the Port Authority of New York &amp; New Jersey contracts out management of Stewart International to a private company named AvPORTS. That company then contracts with a sole IT guy that is only on site two or three times per month.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/9c4bd9f7aefb1f8c3289516c3be2ae4058affa6e8a2a6.png"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">You cannot expect one person to maintain an airport network infrastructure. Doing so is a recipe for security lapses. This is a classic example of what can go wrong with privatization. For-profit companies have every incentive to, all too often, prioritize revenue over best practices.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">This is emphasized by the AvPORTS incident response performance. In an industry at the level of airport management, every employee needs to have at least cursory data breach readiness training. The first person I spoke with at AvPORTS was very nice to me, but at one point asked me if this &ldquo;could wait until tomorrow&rdquo;.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The answer to that question is no. When your company is leaking government-created documents with phrases such as &ldquo;Confidential&rdquo;, &ldquo;For Official Use Only&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Unauthorized release may result in civil penalty or other action&rdquo;, you cannot simply wait until tomorrow. It requires immediate action.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/59a2325501112152df34540afb5472b758affa6e59619.png"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Initial Response</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">I was somewhat relieved when an AvPORTS COO did call me back a few minutes later, around 12pm Pacific US time. He assured me that I would be hearing from their IT staff shortly to further investigate and remedy the situation.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Three and a half hours later I had not heard back from anyone and the data breach was still live. I decided to call the Port Authority. They instructed me to call the Stewart terminal and provided a phone number. During that next call, to the terminal operators, the server&rsquo;s exposed port was closed off to the outside world. It&rsquo;s unknown whether or not this was coincidental timing, as the terminal guys claimed that their department cannot make such a change.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>The IT Guy</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">A few hours later, around 7pm Pacific, I finally received a call from the IT guy. The conversation took an initial downturn. He informed me that I had committed a crime by downloading this data and used the analogy of breaking in and stealing items from someone&rsquo;s home (which could not be further from the truth).</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Fortunately, the conversation evened out when I explained to him that my actions were in no way criminal. The device had been configured in a manner which was distributing these files publicly without a single username, password, or other authentication measure in place. Regardless of intention, this machine was, in essence, acting as a public web server.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Possible Explanations</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">So, how did this happen? Here are some clues-- The IT guy I spoke with informed me that a few months ago the airport had experimented with using a backup software known as ShadowProtect. I was informed that part of the process involved opening port 873 on the firewall and that the ShadowStream service, part of ShadowProtect, may have been utilizing some aspect of the remote synchronization service (rsync). This is just what I was told in that conversation.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">That may be a bit of a red herring though and only part of the puzzle. Within the backups I was able to locate an email chain indicating that AvPORTS purchased at least one Buffalo Terastation backup NAS device in March of 2016.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Those of you that keep up with my work may recall this same make and model of NAS device being at the center of a recently reported Ameriprise Financial data breach. In fact, I have made several other recent breach findings involving this particular device.</p>

<p>My hypothesis is that there may be a default opening of port 873 on some number of Buffalo Terastations. Keep in mind that port 873 had been intentionally opened on Stewart International&rsquo;s firewall during part of the experiment with ShadowProtect.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The current working theory is that these two factors aligned and resulted in a breach scenario. But all of this begs the question: Would such an oversight happen if AvPORTS employed even one full-time IT guy at Stewart?</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">You get what you pay for, even in IT.</p>

Earlier this month I discovered a large collection of publicly exposed MySQL database backup files at an IP resolving to ims-mysql.indycar.com.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The majority of these backups appear to be merely operational, but what stands out are the Indycar employee login credentials as well as the 200k user accounts containing such fields as email, physical address, first and last name, password hash, username, security question and answer, date of birth, and gender. Which essentially makes the find an identity theft treasure trove.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/dd4851699ec9204172ce9caef76c1645589057a988c85.png"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">It&rsquo;s important to point out that the Indycar bulletin board these accounts come from has since been retired. So, there is no need to change your Indycar forum login password. However, if you&rsquo;re the type of person that reuses passwords (and it&rsquo;s a shame that most people are), then you should reset any accounts that might be using the same password. If malicious folks came across this data set, they could be deciphering those passwords and attempting to use them on your other online accounts right now.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/b514b73e2ad0d55baa3e574ca7ce9127589057a835748.png"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">That leads me to something I&rsquo;ve wondered for a while now- Why do companies hold on to password hashes long after the associated site has been shuttered? That&rsquo;s nothing but liability. They are putting customers at risk for no gain. There was absolutely nothing for Indycar to gain by holding on to these password hashes. And now they are faced with negative PR as word of the situation gets out to racing fans.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">I can only assume the attorneys and risk-management folks working for Indycar were unaware that defunct forum logins were being stored. Taking big risks, with zero chance of reward, is not how those types of people keep their jobs. If you&rsquo;re reading this, and you manage risk at a large company, you should really ask your IT staff two important questions:</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">1) What are we storing?</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">2) Do we really need it?</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/8892ff1bf28f85bf177c42115167d914589057a92ee6c.png"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The MacKeeper Security Research Team regularly uncovers breaches containing unnecessary, sensitive data that really didn&rsquo;t need to be there in the first place. And if the liability concerns aren&rsquo;t enough to sway you, just think about it as a cost-saving measure. Storage isn&rsquo;t cheap.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">As we draw an end to this month I&rsquo;ll leave you with a sneak-peak of an upcoming announcement: There&rsquo;s a new 1+ billion leak on the horizon. 1,404,749,583 to be exact. That&rsquo;s not a typo.</p>

This data trove included credit card numbers and expiration dates, many dozens of MySQL databases, internal company email archives, client email archives, and mountains of passwords scattered throughout.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/c147505becd39d09c9678bb0fc67cd4f58833a4bd9273.png"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Curiously, one of the database backups for Annex Media Publishing, a Kwic client, contained the details of all 38 million breached Ashley Madison accounts. What is a publishing company doing with the Ashley Madison dump? Steve Ragan, of CSOOnline (<a href=""http://www.csoonline.com"">http://www.csoonline.com</a>) hasn&rsquo;t been able to get an answer about that from the company.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">I&rsquo;m calling this a near-worst-case-scenario due to only small evidence of infiltration by malicious entities. An r57 PHP shell was located within these backups, which suggests that bad guys have been able to gain at least moderate access to the live production side of one or more Kwic servers. I also saw plenty of support emails discussing clients claiming their websites, hosted by Kwic, were hacked.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/8458429ee9ba00a5f9c8dfc90427e7c158833a4b756f0.png"" style=""height:461px; width:700px"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">If someone with criminal intent had indeed found this motherlode, and really wanted to cause trouble, they could be combing through the mountains of backed up emails in which Kwic staffers regularly pass along plaintext customer passwords. Here&rsquo;s a censored sample:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">As an American, I must admit I&rsquo;m not entirely familiar with Canadian breach notification laws. However, if there is any kind of mandatory reporting, this could quickly turn into a real nightmare situation. Not only would Kwic need to notify thousands of business and residential clients, those clients would then need to turn around and notify all their own clients. That&rsquo;s the nature of high-level breaches where one company is hosting another company&rsquo;s data. Think of it as a trickle-down notification process.</p>

Not a single username or password was guarding this intel, which weighed in at over 11 gigs.</p>

<p>Potomac Healthcare Solutions provides healthcare workers to the US Government through Booz Allen Hamilton (you know, Snowden&rsquo;s old employer). It is not presently known why an unprotected remote synchronization (rsync) service was active at an IP address tied to Potomac. I do know that when I called one of the company&rsquo;s CEOs this past Thursday to report the exposure, he did not seem to take me seriously.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/329c33fa76613eb67ae99fd26fb971d958679dd6c8472.png"" style=""height:546px; width:700px"" /></p>

<p>At the end of our short conversation he asked me to send an email. So, I did. After we hung up, I sent an email to Potomac&rsquo;s two co-CEOs detailing the breach and included their Social Security Numbers, home addresses, dates of birth, and phone numbers. Here&rsquo;s the intro:</p>

<p><em>Hello again Mr. Joseph,</em></p>

<p><em>You and I just spoke over the phone a couple of minutes ago. I described to you a recent publicly-accessible collection of data I have discovered that appears to be internal Potomac Healthcare files. You requested that I send over an email. I have also put Mr. Burden as a recipient and attached a file that should demonstrate that this is not a hoax.</em></p>

<p><em>I am, primarily, concerned for national safety&#39;s sake as there are things like names, email addresses, phone numbers, and Social Security Numbers for people that appear to work both directly at your facilities and at US military installations.</em></p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/f1b014727e976116279fce8f399a504458679dd7bbe6b.png"" style=""height:328px; width:700px"" /></p>

<p>I figured that would do the trick. Much to my surprise, the unprotected file repository was still up and available an hour later. It shouldn&rsquo;t take over an hour to contact your IT guy and kill an rsync daemon.</p>

<p>That last point is especially true when your publicly exposed files contain, in addition to healthcare workers, the names and locations of at least two Special Forces data analysts with Top Secret government clearance.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/2e4a5dd65eb5feae35ece35a91a0d34e58679de16eeb2.png"" style=""height:396px; width:700px"" /></p>

<p>I decided to, basically, call Potomac&rsquo;s boss. I&rsquo;ve made a few contacts at various government agencies, some more helpful than others, most not wanting their names or departments to be mentioned&hellip; ever. So, I went through my email archives and found the appropriate phone number.</p>

<p>Potomac&rsquo;s files went offline about 30 minutes later. I may never know for sure if that second phone call had anything to do with the documents finally being secured, but I&rsquo;d like to think it might have helped.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not hard to imagine a Hollywood plotline in which a situation like this results in someone being kidnapped or blackmailed for information. Let&rsquo;s hope that I was the only outsider to come across this gem. Let&rsquo;s really hope that no hostile entities found it. Loose backups sink ships.</p>

Around December 5th, I discovered Social Security numbers, bank authorization details, confidential internal company documentation, decryption keys, and certificates all alongside approximately 350 client directories (representing millions of invested dollars).</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what we know:&nbsp; The data was coming from a Network Attached Storage device insecurely configured with no username or password required for access. This specific leaky device was not on the internal Ameriprise network, as it was physically located inside an Ameriprise employee&rsquo;s home. But then how did it receive and store unencrypted, internal Ameriprise data? That&rsquo;s the mystery.<br />
It turns out that an identical NAS device exists within this employee&rsquo;s satellite Ameriprise office, and somehow the devices were synchronizing with each other over the open internet. I found it through a random review of Shodan.io rsync results.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/d3177022d916bb6e7651e190b56bef15585313c6932ad.png"" style=""height:498px; width:700px"" /></p>

<p>Out of an abundance of caution, Ameriprise has pulled both devices and will be examining them within an internal IT lab.</p>

<p>Through journalist Zack Whittaker, of CNET/ZDNET/CBS, I&rsquo;ve heard that Ameriprise is claiming the company does not supply these devices to their offices. This may be at odds with what I was told by the affected financial advisor in question. I was informed that the very reason he had one of the devices in his house was because it is the same exact model of device they use at his office.</p>

<p>Now, that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that Ameriprise specifically deployed or even authorized the use of that device within the advisor&rsquo;s office. However, an Ameriprise employee did indicate to me that the pulling and examining of the devices was, in part, to make sure there wasn&rsquo;t a bigger problem to worry about. To me, that says there is at least some concern that more of these devices may be out in Ameriprise offices. That&rsquo;s not to say there&rsquo;s any reason to think more may be misconfigured in the same way, but it&rsquo;s at least worth looking into as a possibility.</p>

<p>When Zack Wittaker asked how Ameriprise secures NAS devices that its offices may be using, Ameriprise&rsquo;s PR people replied, &ldquo;We provide a secure online storage solution for this information.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I find it odd, then, that within the leaked data there is a confidential Business Continuity Plan (BCP), dated Feb. 4<sup>th</sup>, 2015, in which Ameriprise asks its advisors <em>&ldquo;Do you keep your backup computer records (i.e. hard drive, memory stick, etc.) at a location other than your office?&rdquo;</em>, to which the possible answers are <em>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;</em>, <em>&ldquo;No&rdquo;</em>, and <em>&ldquo;N/A &ndash; (select this option if you are using an online solution)&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/5d16fce1e4d43e2875e4d742b21d8d34585313c5772e4.png"" style=""height:824px; width:600px"" /></p>

<p>Why would that question even exist if Ameriprise only provides a secure online storage solution?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additional security and compliance documentation within the leaked files make plenty of references to physically securing flash drives and external hard drives, so Ameriprise has to know that these kinds of devices do actually exist within their offices. That&rsquo;s essentially what a Network Attached Storage device is &ndash; one or more external hard drives connected to a computer network, generally for the sole purpose of data storage and backups.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/c2eab22534f9b1ecc3349200402d2eb1585313c618ab6.png"" style=""height:454px; width:700px"" /></p>

<p>The biggest question, that will probably never be answered, is whether or not I could have used any of the gathered credentials to gain access into Ameriprise&rsquo;s internal network. Doing so would be a clear violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which makes even attempting it off-limits to me and my research efforts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One avenue that a real criminal hacker could have pursued would be cracking the password-manager backup files contained within the data trove. The financial advisor uses 1Password to manage his web credentials. This means that hashed versions of all his passwords were included. Only one &ldquo;master password&rdquo; would need to be cracked and then all of them would be made available in plain text. A password hint file was even included pertaining to this master password. Considering what&rsquo;s in the hint file, I&rsquo;m pretty sure the master password could be cracked.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re an Ameriprise client, and received a notification letter about this event, I&rsquo;d love to see a copy. There are still many questions to be answered and I&rsquo;m hoping the affected clients are provided a detailed and accurate account of what transpired. Ameriprise is a big name and they should set the bar high with a detailed report of how this happened.</p>

If bad guys wanted to know where explosives are being held, or who to blackmail into obtaining explosives, this would have been a prime knowledge base.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">High quality scans of explosives handling licenses were also found in the files, which raises the possibility of impersonating authorized explosives handling personnel. Most of the time data breaches are limited to fraud as far as potential damage goes. The knowledge and credentials contained in this one could have been used to cause some real damage.</p>

<p>The company ultimately responsible for the present leak, Allied-Horizontal, runs a wirelining outfit. Part of this business is known as &ldquo;perforation&rdquo; (the process of putting explosives in the ground and strategically blowing them up). Companies that handle such explosives are tightly regulated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF).</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">This repository, which was exposed to the public internet without any authentication, is another recent example of Network-Attached-Storage devices gone awry via the remote synchronization service (rsync). One particular brand of NAS devices, which starts with a &ldquo;B&rdquo;, appears to be especially prone to this misconfiguration (more on that in a future post).</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">After downloading over 7 gigs of internal Allied-Horizontal files, which represents only a small fraction of the overall exposure, I became convinced the data was legitimate and the leak should be plugged quickly.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/866b0a0602a5adc60661b6137cf19245583fdd1952fa2.png"" style=""height:636px; width:700px"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">In my early days of breach reporting, I would start by notifying employees at the bottom and working my way up, but I&rsquo;ve recently become more brash in my approach. Now I start the notification process with the most senior executive and work my way down. Things happen much faster that way.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">One of the files I downloaded was a spreadsheet containing the names, titles, and personal cell phone numbers of, what appeared to be, all employees at the company.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/59cd0cb3dbf00475a6c18fb9110d6f04583fdd1b0234d.png"" style=""height:427px; width:700px"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/93ba65dbf6ce3781eca04239165b9daa583fdd1a24d32.png"" style=""height:393px; width:300px"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/29d426cc255be589a979fb6375c83290583fdd1aacb98.png"" style=""height:368px; width:300px"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">So, I looked up the Allied-Horizontal CEO&rsquo;s cell phone number and gave him a call this past Monday (Nov. 28th). After I explained a few things, he understood the potential seriousness of the situation. I asked if there was an IT department I could contact and he offered to immediately pass my phone number to them. A few minutes later the IT department gave me a ring. The leaky server was secured nearly as quickly as I could hand over the IP address. They wasted no time.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Their IT department also gets bonus points for not suggesting that I somehow &ldquo;hacked&rdquo; them. They were actually very grateful for the heads-up and couldn&rsquo;t have been nicer to me. It&rsquo;s refreshing when that happens.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The moral of this story is that companies should be regularly hitting their important IP addresses with tools like nmap and masscan (or even looking themselves up on Shodan.io or Zoomeye.org). Heck, throw Censys.io into the mix while you&rsquo;re at it. Keeping an eye on all potential exposure points is a tough task. It&rsquo;s unfortunate that most companies either can&rsquo;t afford dedicated network security staffers, or the C-level executives don&rsquo;t understand the immense impact of a data breach scenario.</p>

The data is usually secured shortly after my notification attempts, but a proper response should not simply end there.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">For example, let&rsquo;s look at the Sheet Metal Workers Union. In early October, I found a database backup belonging to their Northern California branch which contained over 24,900 members&rsquo; names, social security numbers, phone numbers, addresses, ethnicity, beneficiaries, etc., etc. Basically, if I was an identity thief, I would never need another list of victims, and they left it completely exposed to the public internet through a passwordless rsync server.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">In addition to that database backup file, there were PDF union member files named in the following fashion: &ldquo;Last Name, First Name, Social Security Number.pdf&rdquo;. Can you believe someone thought that would be a good idea?</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">So, on October 10th I left a voicemail with the Northern California branch&rsquo;s main office explaining the security blunder. The database and other files were secured sometime shortly thereafter (within a day or two). However, I haven&rsquo;t heard anything in response from the Sheet Metal Workers Local 104. They have my name and phone number. They know that my message was accurate. Shouldn&rsquo;t they have some questions for me? Perhaps so that when they (hopefully) let their members know of the security failure, the union can at least be fully informed of every relevant detail. That seems like the reasonable thing to do.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/c36cce43122d71df74c601031d23263d582c6e751bd9d.png"" style=""height:355px; width:700px"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Now, let&rsquo;s look at a slightly more complex example: &nbsp;Did you know that State Farm recently had a fairly serious data breach incident? Around 3,000 extremely detailed client files were leaking out onto the open internet. It&rsquo;s true, but technically the leak stemmed from one of State Farm&rsquo;s Pennsylvania law firms, Goldberg Miller &amp; Rubin, rather than directly from State Farm. There should be a redacted screenshot above this post illustrating the very personal nature of these files.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/a32fa40b9be5122a8b69f0ba744e9985582c6e6886ae1.png"" style=""height:443px; width:700px"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/12d1718a07a994e77c3fd4410f5fa088582c6e694c3a0.png"" style=""height:333px; width:700px"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">I spoke with Goldberg Miller &amp; Rubin in mid-October, and the data was secured within a few hours, but I don&rsquo;t know for sure if the law firm ever told State Farm about the situation. This, as I recently learned, could lead to some hefty consequences. State Farm is more than just an insurance company. They actually run a bank these days. That binds State Farm to the high standards of security that a financial institution must follow. These standards are heavily regulated and can be viciously enforced.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">What I&rsquo;m trying to say is this- &ldquo;Hey State Farm, did Goldberg Miller &amp; Rubin tell you about the leak? Feel free to get in touch with me if you&rsquo;d like to know more about the situation.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">I feel like ending on a high note, so let&rsquo;s move on to a much better example of incident response involving US Military related data: &nbsp;A retired colonel, named John Warden, runs a consultancy business called Venturist Inc. This company provides &ldquo;strategic planning and execution training for management and leadership teams.&rdquo; Colonel Warden is the architect behind the US Air Superiority strategy which was utilized during the first Gulf War and, from seeing the files which were exposed, it is apparent that he still provides some level of advice to the US Military.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/be67100b0a6e89255306fc1d687beca0582c6e69cebf1.png"" style=""height:765px; width:700px"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Venturist Inc, like the previous two organizations mentioned in this post, were running an unauthenticated, publicly exposed, rsync service which was connected to an internal company file system. Screenshots, that I have redacted, showing the kind of files which could be found are included with this post (probably the last two images above, as I&rsquo;m never quite positive which order they will end up displayed on this page).</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Col. Warden took quick action. He had an employee call me the day following my weekend breach notification email and voicemail message. During this call, the employee and I were able to figure out which storage device was causing the problem and, as an immediate quasi-fix, she unplugged the unit from its power outlet. I confirmed to her that as soon she unplugged it, the data became unreachable on my end.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">I&rsquo;ll leave you with the appreciative email I received later that day from Col. John Warden himself. Keep this in mind the next time you hear about a security researcher being attacked in response to a breach notification:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><em><strong>Dear Chris,</strong></em></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><em><strong>Thank you so much for bringing this to our attention and double thanks for going to the trouble of finding emails and phone numbers. &nbsp;[&hellip;] without you, we would have gone blithely about our business and been feeding data to all kinds of nasty people. &nbsp;If there is anything I can do for you, please let me know. &nbsp;Among other things, I would be delighted to send you a copy of my book Winning in FastTime. &nbsp;Just give us a FedEx address when you can. &nbsp;Again, many thanks and continued good luck with your research and reporting!</strong></em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><em><strong>Best,</strong></em></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><em><strong>John Warden</strong></em></p>

1,2016-10-29T00:00:00.000Z,Habitat for Humanity Breach,habitat-for-humanity-breach,post_5d52518e74b92c96d30246b097798324.jpg,58b0418af6069dec3a951054,Chris Vickery ,1,2017-04-04T09:02:41.111Z,2017-02-28T14:46:10.750Z,https://mackeeper.com/blog/post/294-habitat-for-humanity-breach,0,Habitat for Humanity Breach,,,"<p>There&rsquo;s been a data breach at Habitat for Humanity of Michigan. But they have been unwilling to talk about it or even acknowledge that the event occurred. I&rsquo;ve been trying to speak with the organization about it for three weeks now with no luck.</p>

<p>Habitat for Humanity is a large, international charity that builds and provides low-income housing. Ex-president Jimmy Carter is a vocal supporter of the organization. They do good things and help a lot of people. That is why is pains me to report on the poor data breach incident response of their Michigan branch.</p>

<p>The silence on Habitat&rsquo;s side may be somewhat related to the fact that their Colorado branch recently announced an actual hack, rather than a simple exposure of data, that has been crippling operations. Having to announce a second, separate, breach within a month is probably not on the top of Habitat&rsquo;s wish list. But it&rsquo;s the right thing to do.</p>

<p>Here are the technical details-- Habitat for Humanity of Michigan is a client of a web hosting provider named Providence, which in turn gets service from an ISP named ACD. All of these companies are based in Michigan. During the course of my research, I discovered a publicly exposed remote synchronization (rsync) service that was operating on an ACD IP address.</p>

<p>Most of the files available from this rsync service were encrypted with ShadowProtect backup software. However, there was a notable exception: The Habitat for Humanity of Michigan files. It appears that either someone simply forgot to encrypt them, or whoever does IT for Humanity chose not to take advantage of the encryption, or perhaps the files were scheduled for encryption but it had not yet taken place.</p>

<p>Whatever the case, I soon had over 400 gigabytes of virtual hard drive data stemming from Habitat for Humanity of Michigan.</p>

<p>Looking through 400 gigs in order to see if personal information had been exposed can be a little challenging. I soon found a directory with over 700 folders containing PDF background and credit check reports. You can imagine how sensitive these reports are. They contain everything a malicious actor would need for identity theft. I also quickly found a SQL database backup file with a bevy of information, including over 4,600 peoples&rsquo; social security numbers, names, addresses, phone numbers, etc.</p>

<p>It was after normal business hours on October 9th when I confirmed that sensitive information was indeed exposed by this hosting breach. Fortunately ACD (the ISP involved) has a 24-hour hotline for technical issues. I called and spoke with a young man who said he would look into the situation. When I checked on it the following day, the rsync service was no longer accepting public connections.</p>

<p>A few days later I followed up with Habitat to make sure that ACD had notified them of the issue. Later investigation, conducted by Dell Cameron of The Daily Dot (http://www.dailydot.com/layer8/habitat-for-humanity-applicants-michigan-data-breach) revealed that ACD had in fact contacted Providence, who appear to be the main hosting provider for Habitat&rsquo;s Michigan branch.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, Providence did not inform Habitat. Although it would be nice if Habitat could confirm that for me.</p>

<p>Whatever the case, Providence provided Dell Cameron with a little background: &ldquo;I will tell you that the way that it was presented to us made it sound like [Vickery] may have been a hacker and that it may have been a phishing scam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That is interesting because, even if I was some sort of malicious hacker, they still should have informed Habitat that there had been a data breach. I&rsquo;m not sure how phishing could have fit into the mix. At this point I already had the data. There&rsquo;s no point in phishing for credentials or other information if the data is already publicly exposed and has been handed out.</p>

<p>Overall, the incident seems to have been handled very badly by three separate parties. If the information I have gathered is correct, then ACD should not have represented to Providence that some sort of &ldquo;hacking&rdquo; occurred, Providence should have at least requested my information from ACD (which I had provided) in order to look into the issue, and Habitat for Humanity of Michigan should have at least responded to my data breach notifications.</p>

<p>This all goes to show that the current state of data breach response is not good. Very few companies will own up to making mistakes, very few will accurately communicate information surrounding the event, and even fewer will follow through with a well-planned incident response plan. Most will do everything possible to avoid notifying the affected clients or &ldquo;victims&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I will continue working to improve this sad state of affairs.</p>

1,2016-10-17T00:00:00.000Z,Lawful Conduct,lawful-conduct,post_537be8344358c20adfd99613e3bc8404.jpg,58b0418af6069dec3a951054,Chris Vickery ,1,2017-04-04T09:02:41.111Z,2017-02-28T15:33:17.935Z,https://mackeeper.com/blog/post/283-lawful-conduct,0,Lawful Conduct,,,"<p>There is good reason to be concerned when someone dies in jail. One recent breach I discovered casts doubt on findings of the Orange County DA&rsquo;s office regarding a recent in-custody death.</p>

<p>**Please note:&nbsp; if you represent either side in the case of Oppenheimer v. La Habra, you should probably not read past this point**</p>

<p>Can you imagine what would happen if a law firm inadvertently published their collection of electronic client files to the public internet? I can&rsquo;t find any examples of this happening&hellip; until now.</p>

<p>My investigation into the remote synchronization protocol (&ldquo;rsync&rdquo;) has uncovered several law firms that were, perhaps unknowingly, publishing their internal file repositories to the world. Anyone with an internet connection could have downloaded these files, as they were being hosted on public IP addresses with no username or password protection. There is absolutely no form of hacking involved whatsoever here.</p>

<p>Client files are the crown jewels of a law firm and supposed to be kept under lock and key, which makes these internet-accessible discoveries even more surprising.</p>

<p>Publishing your own internal files through the public internet, via rsync protocol may be foolish, but it is not my job to ascertain the motives of law firms that, for whatever reason, wish to cause their own data breaches. Furthermore, according to the California Bar Association&rsquo;s ethics hotline, there is nothing that a law firm can do to remove these documents from my possession.</p>

<p>I had every intention of simply writing a small post about the situation and deleting the whole 500+ gigabytes of gathered legal data. But then I saw something that I can&rsquo;t un-see.</p>

<p>It involves a jail cell death video that is present in these files. On January 2nd, 2015, Daniel Oppenheimer hanged himself while in a holding cell at the La Habra city jail. Oppenheimer&rsquo;s daughter is now suing for wrongful death. The District Attorney&rsquo;s investigation concluded that there was no wrongdoing on the part of jail staff and that Mr. Oppenheimer&rsquo;s own decision to take his life was the sole factor leading to his death.</p>

<p>I found evidence to the contrary. Within the client files for the Law Firm of Ferguson, Praet &amp; Sherman, there is a text file titled &ldquo;attorney notes WORK PRODUCT&rdquo;. The content of that file is a timeline of events from Oppenheimer&rsquo;s death video. Most of the noted events correspond with the timeline that is present in the District Attorney&rsquo;s official report.</p>

<p>However, there are notable exceptions. Twice, while Daniel Oppenheimer strangles to death, La Habra jail staff members walk past his cell and do nothing to stop it. In the video you can clearly see their reflections in the plexiglass as they walk by. The first pass is nearly six minutes before anyone radios for help.</p>

<p>This &ldquo;attorney notes WORK PRODUCT&rdquo; file shows that an attorney with Ferguson, Praet &amp; Sherman noticed these reflections in the video. It indicates that someone at Ferguson, Praet &amp; Sherman knows that the District Attorney&rsquo;s report is missing these key timeline entries.</p>

<p>It would certainly be awkward for the City&rsquo;s defense attorneys to point out deficiencies in the DA&rsquo;s report. But it&rsquo;s the right thing to do. And for all I know, someone at Ferguson, Praet &amp; Sherman may have indeed pointed this out to the appropriate channels, but I have seen no evidence of that.</p>

<p>I cannot sit idly by and do nothing in this situation. I cannot simply delete these files. My conscience will not allow it. If someone must face scrutiny in order for this truth to get out, then let it be me. It is a burden I will gladly bear in order to see that potential manslaughter does not get swept under the rug.</p>

<p>Daniel Oppenheimer may not have been a great person. He was an admitted meth user and had a long history of run-ins with the law. But when a staff member at the La Habra City jail had a duty to act, this video shows that they did not.</p>

<p>I am calling on the Orange County District Attorney to take another look at this death video and act appropriately against the individuals that walked past and did nothing while a man, in their care, strangled to death.</p>

<p>A company known as EMR4All is responsible for placing these files in an open Amazon S3 repository (known as a bucket). This bucket was located at <a href=""http://emr57.s3.amazonaws.com"">http://emr57.s3.amazonaws.com</a> as recently as two weeks ago. Tech-savvy readers will know that Amazon S3 buckets tend to include the &ldquo;s3.amazonaws.com&rdquo; part of that URL by default. That means, in order to find these files, all you had to do was guess the phrase &ldquo;emr57&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So, how did I find it? Well, after noticing a separate, properly-secured, company using the Electronic Medical Record acronym (EMR) in their S3 bucket title, I theorized that it might be worth checking to see if any unsecured emr-titled buckets existed.</p>

<p>Using a simple URL fuzzing program, I began looking for publicly exposed repositories beginning with &ldquo;emr&rdquo;. It took milliseconds to hit on the phrase &ldquo;emr57&rdquo;. Literally. Milliseconds.</p>

<p>In one of the images above this post, you&rsquo;ll see a full listing of directories which were displayed to me without so much as a username or password being requested. You&rsquo;ll also see an image containing a collage of medical practice logos found within the S3 bucket.</p>

<p>The folder that immediately grabbed my attention is the one titled EMR4allMaster. Past experience has shown that when you find a vast array of seemingly private data exposed, anything marked with the word &ldquo;master&rdquo; is worth investigating in order to identify the overall responsible party.</p>

<p>Googling the phrase &ldquo;EMR4all&rdquo; pointed me in the right direction, but unfortunately the company&rsquo;s homepage did not have any readily identifiable contact information. It was just a login portal for their clients with no contact phone number or email address to be seen.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s one piece of advice I could impart to all holders of healthcare data, it&rsquo;s this: &nbsp;Make sure you prominently display some method of contact on your homepage. When someone notices you are leaking data, you want that person to be able to contact you directly. Things get exponentially more complicated with each additional person that has to be contacted before the breach is secured.</p>

<p>Fortunately for me, I have a good working relationship with the administrator of databreaches.net (she goes by the name Dissent). After I could not quickly contact someone at EMR4All, she became instrumental in getting the breach secured. Dissent has high-level insurance industry contacts. One of them was able to get Amazon&rsquo;s attention, who, in turn, notified EMR4All of the security issue. You can read Dissent&rsquo;s side of the story here: &nbsp;<a href=""https://www.databreaches.net/dozens-of-clinics-thousands-of-patients-impacted-by-third-party-data-leak"">https://www.databreaches.net/dozens-of-clinics-thousands-of-patients-impacted-by-third-party-data-leak</a></p>

<p>You may now be wondering what EMR4All has to say about the whole situation. They were kind enough to contact me with the following statement:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>EMR4all, a service provider of Rehab Billing Solutions, was notified by its vendor, Amazon Web Services, on Sunday, September 11th that its &ldquo;S3&rdquo; storage account containing practice information of the customers of our companies, including patient information, was vulnerable because it was accessible to persons outside of our organization. We were also informed that a data researcher discovered the vulnerability.</em></p>

<p><em>We took immediate steps to investigate and determine the source and extent of any access of practice information and the kind of information that might have been accessed. We can report that the vulnerability has been identified and closed, and updated access controls are now in place to secure the S3 account.</em></p>

<p><em>We have also notified all our customers and former customers of this unfortunate situation involving our Amazon Web Service S3 account and are working with them to provide information to their patients. Over the last few months, we have been in the process of moving our customers to new platforms as we were phasing out the company&rsquo;s operations. We have always taken our customers&rsquo; information security very seriously, and we deeply regret any inconvenience this may have caused. We continue to monitor the situation closely, and work with our customers on transitioning practice data and following up with further notifications and appropriate steps. As required, we will inform proper authorities to ensure that this situation is resolved.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Follow-up questions from Dissent also revealed that, according to the company, no more than 30,000 total patients could have been affected by this breach (and it is likely a subset of that total). It&rsquo;s difficult for me to verify this number due to the heterogeneous nature of the .txt and .edi transmittal files included in the data dump. I can&rsquo;t even show you a screenshot of those files because they would have to be completely blacked out. They are simply massive chunks of private medical data strings. What a mess.</p>

<p>Ultimately I&rsquo;m left with one overriding question here-- Why did nobody involved with EMR4All ask me if I downloaded the data? The answer is yes, as I nearly always do&hellip; (and it will soon be purged) But, seriously, why didn&rsquo;t anyone bother to ask? That&rsquo;s usually one of the first questions I get.</p>

You just can&rsquo;t. Until just days ago, Donald Trump&rsquo;s official website (www.DonaldJTrump.com) suffered from a serious misconfiguration that, among other things, was exposing campaign intern r&eacute;sum&eacute;s to the public internet.</p>

<p>The problem was that, if you asked real nicely, Trump&rsquo;s asset repository was willing to hand out insider data. His team had bungled the settings on their Amazon S3 server, located at <a href=""http://assets.donaldjtrump.com.s3.amazonaws.com"">http://assets.donaldjtrump.com.s3.amazonaws.com</a>.</p>

<p>After discovering this asset server&rsquo;s existence, and my URL fuzzer being met with code 301 redirects instead of code 403 denials, I started digging. Because directory listing was disabled, there was no easy way to enumerate folder names within the asset bucket. I was running through a small dictionary of common folder names when I got a hit on a folder named &ldquo;resumes&rdquo;.</p>

<p>But this was still one step away from being a true leak. I needed more than just a folder name. I needed an actual downloadable file, and, due to the server being unwilling to provide a straightforward list of directory contents, I would need to correctly guess the name of a document before any successful download could take place.</p>

<p>Being the bright, young lad that I am, it occurred to me that there could be a few different naming schemes for files within a r&eacute;sum&eacute; directory. If an organized human was moving files into this directory, then perhaps the files would be named something like FirstnameLastname.pdf or Lastname,Firstname.docx. But guessing applicant names would be a complicated and rather tricky way to look for files.</p>

<p>I decided to cross my fingers and hope that whoever designed this system was using an automated script to move files into the r&eacute;sum&eacute; directory. So, what kind of name would an automated script assign? Well, probably something similar to &ldquo;resume_1.pdf&rdquo;.</p>

<p>With a head full of optimism, I quickly pointed my browser to <a href=""http://assets.donaldjtrump.com.s3.amazonaws.com/resumes/resume_1.pdf"">http://assets.donaldjtrump.com.s3.amazonaws.com/resumes/resume_1.pdf</a>. Bingo! I was met with a download dialogue window. The file contained a glut of personal details, work/education history, and references for a young person hoping to become an intern with the Trump campaign.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t spend too much time looking for additional r&eacute;sum&eacute;s. Some basic filename fuzzing readily turned up 24 of them with names ranging from &ldquo;resume2.docx&rdquo; to &ldquo;resume_9.pdf&rdquo; and even &ldquo;resumeDT.pdf&rdquo;. Several redacted samples are pictured above this post.</p>

<p>Having confirmed my suspicions, and definitively proving that a leak of personally identifiable information existed, the next step had to be notifying the appropriate people in order to secure the data and fix the leak. That was the only ethical thing to do, even if it meant that I wouldn&rsquo;t have much time to fully explore the rabbit hole.</p>

<p>Knowing that Trump&rsquo;s team is active on Twitter, I decided to ping them on that platform via my rarely-used Twitter account, @VickerySec. There was no response, so I decided to reach out to a trusted journalist friend that has helped me secure data breaches on several occasions. She is known by the moniker &ldquo;Dissent&rdquo; and is the administrator of Databreaches.net (a site I highly recommend).</p>

<p>Dissent (aka @PogoWasRight on Twitter) was able to contact the right people and get word of the leak to Trump&rsquo;s staff. From there, it didn&rsquo;t take long for the proper server permissions to be applied. Check out her investigation here:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.databreaches.net/trumps-campaign-mute-about-data-security-fail"" target=""_blank"">https://www.databreaches.net/trumps-campaign-mute-about-data-security-fail</a></p>

<p>Ultimately this was an entirely avoidable mistake on the part of Trump&rsquo;s tech staff. We&rsquo;ll probably never know how bad the exposure really was or what other files I could have found. I have zero confidence that the campaign will be honest about that in whatever response they put out publicly (that&rsquo;s if they do actually acknowledge the situation).</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s just hope that Donald&rsquo;s team learned a good lesson here, and, if he is elected, that they are capable of guarding national assets better than their website&rsquo;s assets.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a website that the Motion Picture Association of America doesn&rsquo;t really want you to know about. It&rsquo;s located at http://awards-screeners.com. The reason for the hush-hush nature? Well, this site is apparently used as a hub for previewing unreleased films.</p>

<p>As you might have guessed, awards-screeners.com (and the company responsible for running it, Vision Media Management) had a data breach problem to deal with recently. Almost two weeks ago I called Vision&rsquo;s office to inform them that a MongoDB database, possibly related to their site awards-screeners.com, was completely exposed to the public internet with no username or password required for access.</p>

<p>The biggest immediately recognizable concern within this database was the existence of around 160 usernames and hashed passwords for people whose email addresses end with domains such as @paramount.com, @disney.com, @warnerbros.com, @fox.com, and @spe.sony.com. The user table had a total of about 1,200 entries, but there is reason to believe that some amount of load-balancing test data was also included. The 160 &ldquo;actual logins&rdquo; number is what Vision Media claims to be accurate.</p>

<p>The passwords that accompanied these accounts were strongly hashed (bcrypt algorithm) and salted. While this means that no one would likely be able to quickly crack any of them, given enough time an attacker could still possibly compromise a few of these accounts. Statistically speaking, at least a few of these hashes were likely the result of a user that picked an easy-to-guess base password. These accounts are high-value targets, so the motivation is definitely there for someone to spend the necessary hash cracking time.</p>

<p>Upon me explaining the situation, the employee who initially answered my phone call immediately transferred me to Vision&rsquo;s lead internal counsel. That&rsquo;s fairly impressive. Usually I have to work my way through a few intermediate people before being passed to lead counsel of any company. It&rsquo;s good to see that Vision takes the issue of data breaches very seriously and has apparently trained their staff to act accordingly.</p>

<p>Once I explained the nature of the exposed database to this attorney, he quickly pulled Vision&rsquo;s CTO, Doug Woodard, into the room and had me repeat what I just told him. They were baffled as to how this could happen but both immediately understood the potential seriousness of the situation. Doug, who would become my main contact at Vision, stepped out of the conversation shortly thereafter so that he could make some very urgent calls to figure out what was going on with this MongoDB instance.</p>

<p>Then came the awkward part. I continued, over the phone, to inform Vision&rsquo;s internal counsel that I had actually downloaded a copy of the publicly exposed database. I say this was awkward because, for the first time in all my research efforts, it felt like someone thought I was trying to proposition an extortion scheme. I very quickly clarified that my intentions are completely noble and I am not in any way trying to extort or blackmail anyone. I think we were both relieved when that was made clear.</p>

<p>Our phone call ended with us exchanging contact information for future updates as Vision investigates the situation. After hanging up, I did a quick check to see if the database was still exposed&mdash;it was not. Doug&rsquo;s calls must have rattled some cages and quick action was taken to secure the data.</p>

<p>In the time since that initial phone call, I have spoken with and emailed Doug several times. Most recently these conversations have included an outside attorney, Tanya Forsheit, that Vision hired to represent them in the matter.</p>

<p>Tanya has very impressive credentials in the world of data breach law, which makes her initial email to me somewhat surprising. It stated, in part: &ldquo;As we are investigating, I trust you won&#39;t make any public statements until we know more, and that you won&#39;t use any of the information <strong>that you improperly downloaded</strong>.&rdquo; [emphasis added]</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the gist of my email response back to her:</p>

<p>I fully understand the duty you have to zealously represent the interests of your client. However, I would prefer that we be very careful regarding accusations of improper access. The bottom line is that, until my notification to Vision Media, this database was being published openly to the public internet through Amazon Web Services.</p>

<p>I know that Doug Woodard, CTO of Vision Media, has said there may have been a fault in Amazon&#39;s hosting platform. I find this scenario unlikely and I think you&#39;ll see that Amazon is fairly resistant to any suggestion of problems with their infrastructure.</p>

<p>The most likely explanation is that someone working for, or at, Vision Media made a mistake. It happens. But let&#39;s not shoot the messenger here. I like to think of myself as a fairly jovial, lighthearted person and I&#39;m hoping that you and I can get along. That will be difficult if there are continued accusations of improper activity on my part.</p>

<p>I have cooperated with and contributed to data breach-related investigations conducted by the FTC, FBI, US Navy, HHS/OCR, US Secret Service, and other similar entities. Not a single regulatory or government agency I have interacted with has even suggested that what I do, downloading publicly published information, is improper.</p>

<p>After those initial tensions, all of my communications with Tanya and Doug have been very good, polite, and welcome. While I have not completely bought into Vision Media Management&rsquo;s explanations of how this data breach occurred (or their claims that the database contains a majority of harmless test data), it has at least not been an unpleasant experience speaking with them.</p>

<p>If they had not been so kind to me, or if they had tried to label me some kind of evil hacker, I might not have been inclined to send them a second breach notification report this past weekend:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Hey again,</em></p>

<p><em>Sorry to be the bearer of (more) bad news, but it appears there are at least a few more, fairly important, holes for Vision to plug. I did a little digging into the &quot;test data&quot;, just to verify what you have been saying, and it has led me to more completely exposed data that gives an even greater understanding into how Vision Media&#39;s system works.</em></p>

<p><em>Specifically, I ran across the publicly exposed S3 buckets located at &quot;http://mpaa.visionmm.resources.s3.amazonaws.com&quot; and &quot;http://travis.visionmm.resources.s3.amazonaws.com&quot;.</em></p>

<p><em>These documents, that are currently exposed to anyone with an internet connection, shed light on the interplay between Vision/Deluxe Media, Kaltura, Netflix, and other players.</em></p>

<p><em>I&#39;m fairly certain this reaches beyond the implications of harmless junk data. I&#39;m also certain that people with actual malicious intent could cause harm if they came across all of this data and set about some time to reverse engineer the authentication measures. There are implications far beyond salted hashes here (Kaltura &quot;ks IDs&quot; might ring a bell for Doug).</em></p>

<p><em>[&hellip;]</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At this time, I&rsquo;m still waiting to hear back from Vision regarding the content of those S3 buckets (which included quite a bit of internal development documentation) as well as anything else that they may have found exposed while responding to this second notification.<br />
I&rsquo;ll most likely be writing an update to this post once more is known. For now, take a gander at the screenshots above this post, head over to TorrentFreak.com for additional coverage, and watch this blog for more info.</p>

<p>Thinking about taking a trip to a far away exotic location? You might just have your payment data stored unsecurely and available for anyone with internet access. As payment processors continue to enhance their security measures and encryption methods the real problem is businesses that collect data and then store it in an unsecure way.</p>

<p><strong>[This post has been updated to include statements on behalf of&nbsp;Silverland Hotels &amp; Spas&rsquo; IT team - <em>in italic</em>]</strong></p>

<p>The MacKeeper Security Research Center has discovered an open database belonging to the Silverland Hotel in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam with thousands of unencrypted credit cards.</p>

<p>The cardholder accounts include the payment information of Australian, US, UK citizens and a range of international guests who have stayed at the hotel.</p>

<p>Imagine you have saved and planned for your perfect holiday trip to Vietnam&rsquo;s capital, you booked your luxury hotel and of course you wouldn&#39;t expect your card details and personal info available online. Along with the payment information, database contained also login details, IP and special requests of the guests. The total number of entries reached 6377 items (i.e. credit cards details).</p>

<p>This open database was publically available and required no password to access. The exposed database and the website were hosted on the same IP address.</p>

<p>The first notification was sent to the hotel email address immediately after we have identified the exposure during our weekly security scan on August 12th.</p>

<p>[<em>The first email eventually discovered by Silverland, after being contacted by a customer late in the evening of August 29, in the hotel&rsquo;s junk mail folder was dated August 17 and contained the&nbsp;August 12&nbsp;email, which email did not include any address where it was purportedly sent</em>].</p>

<p>[<em>On August 30, 2016, MacKeeper engaged in a live chat with Silverland discussing the data leak.&nbsp; That very same day, August 30, Silverlands&rsquo; IT team contacted Hostgator about the problem and port 27017 was immediately closed with password protection.&nbsp; On September 6, 2016, Silverland completed the vulnerability assessment verifying that Silverland&rsquo;s web server was secure.&nbsp; Silverland&rsquo;s customers that may have been effected were notified of the data leak by email on September 7, 2016]</em></p>

<p>The <a href=""https://mackeeper.com/blog/category/10"">MacKeeper Security Research Center</a> sent multiple emails, used the live chat feature on the website and spoke with the assistant of the hotel owner using the private phone number found on the domain registry. Customers exposed as they continued to add additional credit card numbers to the database. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It is unclear if the data was accessed by anyone else.</p>

<p>[UPDATE]</p>

<p>The Silverland Hotels &amp; Spas&rsquo; IT team has secured the port in question with password protection, the web server has been secured, the customers that may have been effected have been notified, and Silverland Hotels &amp; Spas is working with the banking institutions to ensure that any potential problems are covered.&nbsp; Additionally, Silverland Hotels &amp; Spas has retained U.S. (Colorado) attorney Ira J. Bornstein to assist them in handling this matter.</p>

1,2016-08-30T00:00:00.000Z,Data Breach at Kingo Energy,data-breach-at-kingo-energy,post_32c5cab8039b54c5de1bad79beb48ece.jpg,58b0418af6069dec3a951054,Chris Vickery ,1,2017-04-04T09:02:41.111Z,2017-02-28T16:01:01.895Z,https://mackeeper.com/blog/post/265-data-breach-at-kingo-energy,0,Data Breach at Kingo Energy,,,"<p>The personal details of over 18,000 Guatemalans, many impoverished, were exposed to the public until just days ago. All indications are that the company responsible for the database exposure, which has now been secured, is a Guatemalan electricity provider named Kingo.</p>

<p>About two and a half months ago I came across a completely unprotected CouchDB installation sitting out on the open internet. As usual in my server scouring, no username or password was required for access. Several screenshots of this database are viewable along with this post.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most disturbing part of this breach is the inclusion of hi-resolution photographic images for both the front and back of Kingo customers&rsquo; Guatemalan national ID cards. Yes, it appears that, along with photos of the signed client contract, Kingo requires agents to take pictures of a new customer&rsquo;s national identification card. Kingo then had the gall to store this highly sensitive data in an open, unprotected database that anyone in the entire world could access with a regular web browser.</p>

<p>Just to clarify a few things-- It did not take the entire two and a half months to get this database secured. Personally, my Spanish is not great and language barriers can be daunting. Two years of high school Spanish has barely left me able to ask for directions. So, while I did understand that this breach would definitely need to be fixed, I put it on the back burner for a little bit while contemplating the best approach to take in contacting the right people.</p>

<p>Following an unrelated Columbian Government-related data breach, I met a high-level, native Spanish-speaking contact at Symantec. After considering him as a possible avenue to help reach the right people at Kingo, I took action on August 24th and, a few days later, the database became password-protected.</p>

<p>Kingo has not been greatly forthcoming on the exact details regarding which of my attempted breach notifications they received first, so I don&rsquo;t know if it was my direct English-written email titled &ldquo;Data Breach Notification,&rdquo; or perhaps my Symantec contact, or one of the other avenues I attempted. However, Kingo has issued the following response:</p>

<p><em>[&hellip;]</em> Our apologies for the late response but we were working on fixing the issue as a top priority.</p>

<p>Please allow us to tell you a bit about who we are and what we do:</p>

<p>Our mission at Kingo is &quot;turning lives on&quot;, by providing a pre-paid solar system service for impoverished communities in Guatemala who lack of electricity. We are working to improve the life quality of many people by providing a solar energy system that provides illumination and positively impacts our customers in several areas such as financial savings, productivity, education, health and security. &nbsp;</p>

<p>As an <em>[sic]</em> startup company we are constantly moving in order to have better and more reliable information systems. This is why we appreciate your inputs related to the recent data base issue reported.</p>

<p>We have taken immediate actions in order to secure the data. We are going to invest the needful resources in order to guarantee the privacy of our customer&#39;s personal information.</p>

<p>Thank you again for your inputs, sincerely</p>

<p>Kingo Team</p>

<p>This is certainly a very polite response from Kingo. They aren&rsquo;t trying to call me a dirty hacker. They haven&rsquo;t tried to blame the breach on a third-party contractor, and they aren&rsquo;t trying to claim that it&rsquo;s just a fictitious database. Those are the usual knee-jerk reaction statements I get from companies (which, by my own estimation, are lies about 90% of the time).</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s just hope I was one of only a few people to discover this database while it was unprotected and exposed. I know that there are many people actively scanning for exposed CouchDB instances, so, while I was probably not the sole person to find it, I&rsquo;m crossing my fingers that no one with identity theft in mind grabbed a copy.</p>

1,2016-08-18T00:00:00.000Z,On the Topic of Sage,on-the-topic-of-sage,post_bb08495e1a926c58af57bc6d2e793f78.jpg,58b0418af6069dec3a951054,Chris Vickery ,1,2017-04-04T09:02:41.111Z,2017-02-28T16:02:23.324Z,https://mackeeper.com/blog/post/263-mackeeper-sage-security,0,On the Topic of Sage,,,"<p>Sage, a major UK-based software company, made headlines recently as it was revealed that&nbsp; insider credentials had been used to access client data in an unauthorized manner. In what&nbsp; appears to be a surprising coincidence, I happened across a decent amount of insecure Sage X3&nbsp; client installations the very same day that I read about the insider credential breach.</p>

<p>Specifically, what I found were over 20 unprotected MongoDBs, under the control of Sage&nbsp;customers, powering &ldquo;on premises&rdquo; versions of Sage&rsquo;s X3 server software suite. The Shodan.io&nbsp;search term used to unearth the list of unprotected installations was &ldquo;port:27017 syracuse&rdquo;. It&nbsp;appears that &ldquo;syracuse&rdquo; is an X3 server reference term.</p>

<p>X3 servers are intended for companies with over 200 employees, so finding more than 20 of&nbsp;them completely exposed to the public internet, with no username or password required for&nbsp;access, was a little unnerving. As you can imagine, some of these servers contained massive&nbsp;amounts of company records in the form of PDFs, DOCs, and XLS spreadsheets.</p>

<p>Initially I had assumed that these servers were under the control of Sage itself and, accordingly, I&nbsp;sent an email notification earlier this week to the company regarding my findings. High-level&nbsp;Sage staff members sent a response back within hours (rather impressive when considering the&nbsp;UK time zone difference). We engaged in a telephone conversation shortly thereafter. The Sage&nbsp;representatives were very clear that while they claim Sage is not at fault for these breaches, Sage&nbsp;is extremely concerned with any situation involving their software being implemented insecurely&nbsp;by clients.</p>

<p>Sage immediately began a process of reviewing the IP addresses I supplied to them and notifying&nbsp;affected customer companies that have been insecurely utilizing Sage&rsquo;s X3 server software. For a&nbsp;company that is claiming to not be at fault, it is noble that Sage would embark on such a quest to&nbsp;notify exposed companies spanning across the globe. Although, considering the potential public&nbsp;relations problems, it is probably in Sage&rsquo;s best interest to do so. That process started two days&nbsp;ago.</p>

<p>So, what other kinds of interesting stuff did I find? Well, the first sign that these servers hadsomething to do with Sage was the presence of &ldquo;[name]@sage.com&rdquo; login credentials. Initially I&nbsp;considered the possibility that this situation could be the cause of Sage&rsquo;s &ldquo;insider credential&rdquo; data&nbsp;breach. That has turned out to not be the case, but the possibility was interesting to say the least.</p>

<p>I can also tell you that certain identical password hashes were present across many of the&nbsp;installations. That strongly indicates identical default passwords being commonplace in X3&nbsp;server implementations. Of course there were also client-specific login credentials as well, and&nbsp;who wants to bet that many of those hashes could be cracked and used to access the also-exposed&nbsp;RDP services and SQL servers found at many of the same IPs?</p>

<p>Also worth noting-- Sage confirmed that one of the exposed X3 servers I located was set up by&nbsp;Sage itself as a demonstration unit. That begs the questions of why Sage would deploy a server,&nbsp;even if it was a demo, that contradicts its own best practices and instructions. A company as&nbsp;large and advanced as Sage should have IT staff that can run a VPN if something like access&nbsp;from a remote demo site is necessary.</p>

<p>I will likely catch some flak for now publishing details on how to locate this type of server. My&nbsp;decision to say something at this point is driven by a few key aspects. First of all, I&rsquo;ve found logs&nbsp;indicating that I am not the first person to discover these exposed servers, so remaining silent&nbsp;would run the risk of less well-intentioned people plundering the data (if none have done so&nbsp;already). Secondly, there&rsquo;s already been two days of Sage working around the clock to notify&nbsp;these exposed companies. If a client company&rsquo;s IT staff is too inept to respond to this kind of&nbsp;urgent notification by now, then there&rsquo;s little hope they will in the near future.</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;m left with what I&rsquo;ll refer to as &ldquo;the nuclear option.&rdquo; That option being to ring some alarm&nbsp;bells and get a public message out. The message is simple: Sage&rsquo;s on premise X3 software are not designed to&nbsp;be exposed to the public internet. If you are a large Sage client, make sure that your software&nbsp;installations are behind a firewall or, at the very least, you have some sort of access restrictions&nbsp;in place. Most companies do, but I know of at least 20 that did not&hellip; and the possible&nbsp;repercussions for those clients are frightening.</p>

It&rsquo;s hard to say for sure though because I can&rsquo;t get a response out of them.</p>

<p>I dispatched the following email to various UandMe contact addresses earlier last week:</p>

<p><em>Hello UandMe,</em></p>

<p><em>I have discovered an apparent data breach involving your organization. There is a publicly exposed MongoDB database sitting out on the internet right now that looks to contain a vast amount of your company&#39;s internal data.</em></p>

<p><em>The server is located at:</em></p>

<p><em>IP address:&nbsp; 182.74.215.75</em></p>

<p><em>Port:&nbsp; 27017</em></p>

<p><em>There is no username or password required to access it.</em></p>

<p><em>If this is indeed your data, please secure the database immediately!</em></p>

<p><em>As I do plan to publicly disclose word of this event (but not the sensitive data itself), I have a few questions:</em></p>

<ol>
	<li><em>How long has this data been exposed?</em></li>
	<li><em>How many users are affected?</em></li>
	<li><em>Will you be notifying your users of this breach?</em></li>
</ol>

<p><em>Please also note that any response, or lack of response, may be included in my reporting of the event.</em></p>

<p>As you can see in the screenshots above this post, the database contains nearly 500,000 &ldquo;USERINFO&rdquo; record entries.</p>

<p>The UandMe website states that the application &ldquo;is developed implementing secure industry-best practices incorporating security reviews in the whole design, prototyping and deployment process.&rdquo; That is clearly not the case if what I found is indeed a copy of their production database.</p>

<p>The database disappeared at some point after my email notification was sent. This leads me to believe that someone at UandMe saw my email and took action.</p>

<p>Lacking any sort of direct response from UandMe, it&rsquo;s hard to say whether or not any affected users will receive notification that their personal info may have been exposed. I have high hopes that appropriate action will be taken, but I guess we&rsquo;ll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>On Saturday, July 9th, 2016, I called Automation Integrated&rsquo;s service hotline to report that they may have a database security issue. The answering technician agreed there could be a problem as I described a CouchDB implementation, requiring no username or password to access, that appeared to contain an alarming amount of internal company files.</p>

<p>Among those files were photographs of security mechanisms (e.g. locks, RFID access panels, and controller boards) from within protected Oklahoma DPS buildings. Database entries contained, among other things, details on the make and model, location, warranty coverage, and even whether or not the unit was still functional.</p>

<p>My telephone conversation ended after I was provided an email address to which I could send details and evidence of the exposure. The technician also informed me that the email would be received by a group of company employees, so I might receive a panicked response.</p>

<p>Not entirely sure what to expect, I sent a brief message to the email address along with photograph attachments including images of the inside of an Oklahoma Highway Patrol building, a collection of surveillance camera stills, and one image taken from within a bank vault. A few of these images are viewable along with this post.</p>

<p>Some hours later my phone rang. It was a VP from Automation Integrated calling to thank me for alerting them to the issue. He took personal responsibility for the oversight and couldn&rsquo;t have been nicer to me. He stated that the issue had been corrected and I verified, while still on the phone with him, that I could no longer access the database.</p>

<p>This is an example of excellent incident response. The guy didn&rsquo;t try to call me a hacker, he didn&rsquo;t try to claim that it was a fake database filled with dummy-data, and he didn&rsquo;t try to deflect responsibility onto another company. What he did do was fix the issue promptly, verify with the original reporter that the issue was fixed, and he appreciated the fact that someone would go out of their way to make sure an issue like this was taken care of.</p>

<p>Sure, in a perfect world the problem would have never existed in the first place. But that&rsquo;s not reality. Automation Integrated is far from alone. I have a constantly fluctuating list of 50 to 100 similar breaches that need to be reported. This one just happened to involve a security-related company and government buildings, so it got bumped to the top of my list.</p>

<p>Companies make these mistakes all the time. I wish more of them would react as well as Automation Integrated did.</p>

<p>A few years ago, Thomson Reuters purchased a company for $530 million. Part of this deal included a global database of &quot;heightened-risk individuals&quot; called World-Check that Thomson Reuters maintains to this day.</p>

<p>As stated by Vice.com, World-Check is used by over 300 government and intelligence agencies, 49 of the 50 biggest banks, and 9 of the top 10 global law firms. The current-day version of the database contains, among other categories, a blacklist of 93,000 individuals suspected of having ties to terrorism.</p>

<p>According to Chris, no hacking was involved in his acquisition of this data. &ldquo;I would call it more of a leak than anything, although not directly from Thomson Reuters. The exact details behind that can be shared at a later time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This copy has over 2.2 million heightened-risk individuals and organizations in it. The terrorism category is only a small part of the database. Other categories consist of individuals suspected of being related to money laundering, organized crime, bribery, corruption, and other unsavory activities.</p>

<p>Thomson Reuters claims that the database has been exposed by a third-party and confirmed that data is now secured. Chris has not released this database to the world.</p>

<p>The database, a CouchDB instance, was located at IP address 104.154.48.169 on port 5984. It was configured for public access with no username, password, or other authentication required. That address resolves to 169.48.154.104.bc.googleusercontent.com (which is the IP address in reverse followed by a google domain name). This indicates that the person or organization responsible for the leaky database was renting server space from Google&rsquo;s Cloud services.</p>

<p>Discover security news and tips at <a href=""https://mackeeper.com/blog/category/10"">MacKeeper Security Research Center</a>.</p>

<p>Each record contained an ID field following the scheme of &ldquo;LAL&rdquo;+[State Abbreviation]+[Record Number] (an example for Alaska would be LALAK176743). A little internet sleuthing showed that a data brokerage company named L2 (http://www.l2political.com) uses the same naming scheme for their records.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, June 21st, 2016, I sent an email to every L2 email address I could easily locate notifying them of the situation. In my email I put forth the theory that a client of theirs was hosting data purchased from L2 in an insecure manner and asked for L2&rsquo;s assistance in getting it taken down. I also attached a screenshot as proof of my findings. It turns out that my hypothesis was correct and L2 was more than willing to help me track down the client at fault.</p>

<p>Shortly after my email went out I received a response from L2&rsquo;s CEO, Bruce Willsie, asking me to give him a call and providing his cell phone number. We had a pleasant conversation and I provided him with additional details that would hopefully assist in identifying exactly which client was responsible.</p>

<p>The database was taken offline within three hours of our telephone conversation. That&rsquo;s a pretty good turnaround time if you ask me. After noticing that the database had disappeared, I sent another email to Bruce asking if L2 would like to make any statement prior to me reporting on the situation. His response was:</p>

<p><em>Hi Chris.&nbsp; Thank you for finding this and thank you for giving us the opportunity to respond.&nbsp; We very quickly identified the national client, informed them immediately and they took down the site as quickly as they could.&nbsp; The client told us that they were hacked, the firewall was taken down and then the probing began.&nbsp; This was an old copy (from about a year ago) of the national file and it had only a very small number of our standard fields.&nbsp; Needless to say, the client is doing its own research now to determine the extent of the incursion.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve asked that they report back to us with their findings and their plan for hardening their system in the future.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s unfortunate and, again, we greatly appreciate your discovery of the problem.</em></p>

<p><em>Best wishes.</em></p>

<p><em>Bruce Willsie</em></p>

<p>The &ldquo;we were hacked&rdquo; explanation comes out a lot in the kind of research that I do. One of the more noteworthy examples of this was when the Citizens&rsquo; Movement political party of Mexico made the same claim after I found an exposed copy of that country&rsquo;s voter database. I have always believed that Citizens&rsquo; Movement was just lying to cover their own mistake.</p>

<p>That doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that L2&rsquo;s client is lying about being hacked, but I am taking it with a grain of salt. If anyone reading this is an expert on Google Cloud hosting, and can offer an opinion of the likelihood of such a hack happening, please comment below or drop me a line at <a href=""mailto:cvickery@kromtech.com"">cvickery@kromtech.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The Serbian Connection:</strong></p>

<p>While I was poking around this publicly exposed US voter profile database, I happened to query the server&rsquo;s log file. The limited results are in the final screenshot above this post. Forgive me for not being more savvy with the CouchDB suite at the time (I&rsquo;ve since learned of better ways to enumerate the log file).</p>

<p>You can see that a Serbian IP, 89.216.31.2, was interacting with this same database back on April 11th of this year. Why was a Serbian IP messing around with a US voter database? Even if this was just a proxy server it is still very troubling that this apparent incursion took place back on April 11th.</p>

<p>If you have any special insight as to which organization may be responsible for this leak, please leave a comment below or send me an email. I&rsquo;ve included a fair bit of information in this post, and maybe someone with better sleuthing skills than myself can help crack the case. I don&rsquo;t think L2 is going to tell us.</p>

<p>Related Articles: Read the <a href=""https://mackeeper.com/blog/post/239-another-us-voter-database-leak"">story of exposed 154 million US voter records</a>.</p>

<p>Most adult men in the US will recognize the Topps brand name. They are the baseball card company that we all know and love. Unfortunately, I have reason to believe the Topps phone apps team may have some data security issues to address, and I can&rsquo;t get a response out of Topps.</p>

<p>Bunt, Huddle, and Kick are three of Topps&rsquo; mobile apps that give fans the opportunity to engage each other on the go. Those same fans may be alarmed to learn that, back in early December of 2015, I stumbled upon three separate, publicly accessible databases containing what I believe to be many hundreds of thousands of user account details for these apps (a different database for each of the three), along with other data tables apparently necessary for the app servers to function.</p>

<p>The good news is that those three databases were secured a few days after I discovered them, which was faster than I could get around to sending notification to Topps. Thinking that was the end of it, I decided to forget about the situation and move onto other things. Little did I know, about two weeks ago, a similarly exposed and publically accessible database would appear (with all three apps&rsquo; data together on this one server).</p>

<p>There has been plenty of opportunity to notify Topps of the apparent leak this time around. In fact, I&rsquo;ve sent emails to three different Topps support addresses:</p>

<p><em>Hello Topps,</em></p>

<p><em>I am a security researcher that occasionally comes across publicly exposed databases. Unfortunately it appears that I may have come across one belonging to you and containing a large amount of sensitive user account information. This looks like it involves data from Topps apps such as Huddle, Bunt, and Kick.</em></p>

<p>[SERVER DETAILS REDACTED]</p>

<p><em>[&hellip;] As I will most likely publicly disclose word of the incident (but not the data itself), it is only fair to let you know that any response, or lack of response, may be included in that reporting.</em></p>

<p><em>-Chris Vickery</em></p>

<p>The only response has been one automated message:</p>

<p><em>Your request (#172563) has been received and will be reviewed by the Topps BUNT Team [&hellip;]</em></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve gotten back from Topps in over a week. At this point, I can&rsquo;t definitively assign any fault to Topps regarding the apparent data leakage. After all, they have not confirmed or denied anything yet. Maybe it&rsquo;s not their data after all, but that would really surprise me. Nevertheless, I can&rsquo;t in good conscience watch this data continue to leak without at least trying to get a warning out.</p>

<p><strong>The Interesting Announcement:</strong></p>

<p>As much as it pains me to say this-- I&rsquo;ve found another exposed US voter profile database. This one has 154 million entries. Stay tuned for details. You&rsquo;ll get all the inside info as soon as the details can be safely shared.</p>

<p>MacKeeper Security Research Center shares the most essential Dos and Don&#39;ts following the data leakage.</p>

<p>On June, 18, hundreds of MacKeeper users and media representatives joined an exclusive webinar hosted by Chris Vickery, MacKeeper Security Researcher. During the 30 minute talk, Chris shared his experience as a data breach hunter and gave some insights into his discoveries, such as Microsoft, US Voter Database, Hello Kitty, uKnowKids child tracking service, and many others.</p>

<p><strong>Here is the link to the recorded session of webinar: </strong><a href=""https://youtu.be/VhSDkUvyKZ8"">https://youtu.be/VhSDkUvyKZ8</a></p>

<p>In addition to the webinar, <a href=""https://mackeeper.com/blog/category/10"">MacKeeper Security Research Center</a> issues the emergency plan for companies experiencing data leakage.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;We discovered dozens of databases and witnessed how different companies responded to the incident and dealt with the aftermath. The problem is that the majority of company representatives still make basic mistakes when learn about the data breach. Data leakage is a stressful and disorienting event, that&rsquo;s why, it is highly important not to panic and stick to a plan</em><em>,&rdquo;</em> says Bob Dyachenko, MacKeeper spokesman.</p>

<p><a href=""https://mackeeper.com/blog/category/10"">MacKeeper Security Research Center</a> outlines the best working tips and the common mistakes they have noticed as companies deal with data leakage.</p>

<p><strong>Dos</strong></p>

<p><strong>Notify the internal team of IT department.</strong></p>

<p>The first step is to investigate the cause for the leakage. This is the task for technical specialist to make an in-depth review of errors and identify what server has been compromised.</p>

<p><strong>Contact the person who found the database.</strong></p>

<p>If it&rsquo;s possible, try to get in touch with the person who reported the data breach. This step is important mainly to get more information upon the flaw: which ports are open, what kind of personal information has been exposed and whether it has been secured. The answers to these questions will help to protect the database much faster and properly build the communication plan both with users and media.</p>

<p><strong>Develop an emergency communication plan.</strong></p>

<p>As soon as you have all information, make an official company statement containing the following information:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Unless your system was hacked, honestly admit the fault and accept responsibility.</li>
	<li>Remember that this statement is made mostly for your customers, that&rsquo;s why, describe what you&#39;re doing about the incident; what you are doing with affected sensitive data (if there was any sensitive data).</li>
	<li>Update the statement as frequently as possible.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Inform all customers of the actions you&#39;ve taken.</strong></p>

<p>In addition to the statement, notify your customers that all steps have been taken to secure their data. Give the users an opportunity to get in touch with you and discuss their concerns. That&rsquo;s why, internal communication is equally important as external. Your support team should be aware of the current situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Don&#39;ts</strong></p>

<p><strong>Do not invent stories and blame hackers for causing the data breach.</strong></p>

<p>After <a href=""https://mackeeper.com/blog/post/192-uknowkidscom-database-error-exposed-sensitive-information-on-1700-kids"">uKnowKids.com database leakage</a>, company&rsquo;s representative tried the intimidation tactics against Chris Vickery and even tried to pretend his firm to be a victim of a hacker. Such stories are likely to come to the surface and show that your priority is not users but your reputation.</p>

<p>With so much sensitive information, immediate notice on uKnowKids&rsquo; site should have been the first step to calm down the concerned parents.</p>

<p><strong>Do not claim that the database was fictitious when it&rsquo;s real.</strong></p>

<p>The recent case with <a href=""https://mackeeper.com/blog/post/231-pacific-gas-and-electric-database-exposed"">Pacific Gas and Electric</a>, electric utility company in California, showed that lies is not the best idea to solve the problem. Fictitious databases do not generally have areas specifically marked development, production, and enterprise. They do not generally have over 688,000 unique log record entries. This database did.</p>

<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t alarm your users.</strong> You should have a single key message and take a control over the situation.</p>

<p>Finally, as soon you know how the breach has happened, you can take measures to avoid future incidents.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE (Jun 1st)</strong>: <em>This post has been updated to include statement from PG&amp;E</em></p>

<p>Last week I discovered a data breach involving Pacific Gas and Electric, a very large electric utility company in California. The publicly exposed database appeared to be PG&amp;E&rsquo;s asset management system. Among other things, it contained details for over 47,000 PG&amp;E computers, virtual machines, servers, and other devices. All of it completely unprotected. No username or password required for viewing.</p>

<p>Follow the latest security news and data breaches at <a href=""https://mackeeper.com/blog/category/10"">MacKeeper Security Research Center with Chris Vickery</a>.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re talking about IP addresses, operating systems, hostnames, locations, MAC addresses, and more. This would be a treasure trove for any hostile nation-state hacking group. That&rsquo;s not to mention the 120 hashed employee passwords, or the plaintext NTLM, SOAP, and mail passwords.</p>

<p>Does anyone recall a recent example of hackers crippling an electric utility? I do:&nbsp; <a href=""https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid"">https://www.wired.com/2016/03/inside-cunning-unprecedented-hack-ukraines-power-grid</a></p>

<p>Before going any further I want to let you know that PG&amp;E&rsquo;s IT department is trying to claim that the database was &ldquo;fake&rdquo;. However, I want you to also know that nearly every data breach that I find is initially claimed to be fake. It&rsquo;s a quick, easy excuse when your company is caught with its pants down and, if it works, you get off free and clear. But that excuse isn&rsquo;t going to work this time.</p>

<p>Fictitious databases do not generally have areas specifically marked development, production, and enterprise. Fictitious databases do not generally have over 688,000 unique log record entries. This database did.</p>

<p>Sure, it&rsquo;s theoretically possible to create software that could generate massive amounts of fake data, but companies don&rsquo;t do that. Even if a database is for development purposes only, they tend to fill it with real production data. They do that because production data is easily available and free. Companies generally do not pay people to sit around and create great swaths of false data when plenty of data already exists to use. I&rsquo;ve seen it over and over again.</p>

<p>To be clear, I absolutely do not believe PG&amp;E&rsquo;s claim that this is all fictitious data. They sure took it down quickly after I notified them on Thursday, May 26th.</p>

<p>PG&amp;E didn&rsquo;t bother to ask me if I downloaded a copy of this open, publicly exposed database. I&rsquo;ll tell you now that I did. I still have it.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I would like to provide it to the US Department of Homeland Security so that they can 1) determine whether or not the data is genuine; and 2) take appropriate actions in the event that hostile actors also found the database.</p>

<p>So, if you work for DHS and you&rsquo;re reading this, please contact me at <a href=""mailto:cvickery@kromtech.com"">cvickery@kromtech.com</a> if you are interested in verifying the data set and taking appropriate measures to remediate in the event that other parties also obtained a copy.</p>

<p><strong>PG&amp;E Statement</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>With this incident, it is important to know that none of PG&amp;E&rsquo;s systems were directly breached in any way and no customer or employee data was involved.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A PG&amp;E vendor was hosting an online demonstration using PG&amp;E asset management data to show the capabilities of a platform that they were developing for us. &nbsp;This data contained information on PG&amp;E&rsquo;s technology assets, such as computers and servers.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Our initial review indicated that the data was non-sensitive, mocked-up data. We based this feedback on an initial response from the vendor stating that the information in the database was demo or &ldquo;fake&rdquo; data. Following further review, we learned that the data was not fake and removed access.</li>
	<li>We continue working with all of our vendors to have appropriate procedures in place at all times to protect PG&amp;E data in those instances when they have it.</li>
</ul>

I reported it to the Mexican electoral authority (INE) that same day.</p>

<p>Today, INE held a press conference and reported that the database has been taken offline. Their initial investigations indicate that the data pertains to the region of Sinaloa. I cannot confirm or deny that aspect at this time.</p>

<p>As far as I know, they did not mention the political party responsible for this leak. I can report that the database was titled &ldquo;DBPRI&rdquo; and all signs point to the PRI party as being responsible here. I have included a few screenshots further illustrating the database with this post.</p>

<p>I plan to post more about the situation as things develop.</p>

<p>And yes, I do have a copy of it.</p>

Coincidentally they both involve sites that show videos to their user base.</p>

<p>The first has to do with TheTreesNetwork.com, a marijuana-enthusiast site where people are invited to casually gather and chat while watching videos that appeal to that target demographic. Personally, I have no feelings one way or the other regarding marijuana usage. But I do have a soft spot in my privacy-loving heart for people who may be saying incriminating things in an online chat without knowing that logs are being kept and their identities could be easily compromised by a breach.</p>

<p>On May 8th, I notified the site of their unprotected MongoDB database in an unusual, but certainly effective way. After joining the chat, I wrote &ldquo;What would you do if I had proof that this site is leaking user details?&rdquo;. The response from the crowd was basically, &ldquo;Prove it.&rdquo; So, I did by posting an Imgur.com link to an image showing an overview of the database (but not the specific IP address or any user details).</p>

<p>Learn more about <a href=""https://mackeeper.com/security"">MacKeeper Security tools</a> that helps you stay protected while surfing online.</p>

<p>An admin was very quick to respond, as I expected. He (or possibly she) fixed the problem in mere minutes. It may have been the world&rsquo;s fastest incident response.</p>

<p>As you can see in the first screenshot above this post, the unprotected Trees Network database contained over 10 million chat messages coming from over 44,000 users. I&rsquo;m willing to bet that some of those chats would qualify as self-incriminating.</p>

<p>If anyone had admitted to criminal activity in one of those chat messages, then that person might be alarmed to learn that The Trees Network also keeps logs of its users&rsquo; IP addresses (see the second screenshot above). So, even if you are chatting under a pseudonym, all it would take is a subpoena to your internet service provider to find out who you are (assuming that a proxy or VPN is not being used).</p>

<p>The passwords found in the database were obscured using a strong hashing method (bcrypt). So, while it would be a good idea for users of the site to change their passwords, it wouldn&rsquo;t be trivial for a malicious actor to break them.</p>

<p>The lesson to learn here is to always be careful about what you say online. You never know when it might come back to haunt you.</p>

<p><strong>Breach #2</strong></p>

<p>I believe the second data breach that I&rsquo;m mentioning today involves the site Telly.com. However, I can&rsquo;t be absolutely certain about that because they won&rsquo;t answer my emails, they haven&rsquo;t responded to Twitter messaging, and their DMCA phone line gives me a busy signal. It&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to alert them that they may be leaking account details of over 14 million users. Telly.com seems to be a primarily Arabic site, but plenty of it is in English, so I was hoping we could communicate. If you speak their native language, perhaps you could ask them to contact me at <a href=""mailto:cvickery@kromtech.com"">cvickery@kromtech.com</a> so we can discuss the potential breach. As you can see in the third screenshot above this post, it could be a fairly serious one.</p>

It is proof that someone moved confidential government data out of Mexico and into the United States. It is a hard drive with 93.4 million downloaded voter registration records&mdash; The Mexican voter database.</p>

<p>See the interview with Chris Vickery&nbsp;commenting on this breach:&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0mlhrtb4W0&amp;rel=0"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0mlhrtb4W0&amp;rel=0</a></p>

<p>Before going any further, let&rsquo;s make one thing very clear. I&rsquo;m not the one who transmitted the data out of Mexico. Someone else will have to answer for that. However, eight days ago (April 14th), I did discover a publicly accessible database, hosted on an Amazon cloud server, containing these records. There was no password or authentication of any sort required. It was configured purely for public access. Why? I have no clue.</p>

<p>After reporting the situation to the US State Department, DHS, the Mexican Embassy in Washington, the Mexican Instituto Nacional Electoral (INE), and Amazon, the database was finally taken offline April 22nd, 2016.</p>

<p>Under Mexican law, these files are &ldquo;strictly confidential&rdquo;, carrying a penalty of up to 12 years in prison for anyone extracting this data from the government for personal gain. We&rsquo;re talking about names, home addresses, birthdates, a couple of national identification numbers, and a few other bits of info.</p>

<p>Earlier this week I gave a talk at Harvard University&rsquo;s Center for Government and International Studies building, primarily on the topic of data breaches. As luck would have it, there was a student from Mexico present. After the talk, during which I had announced this latest breach discovery, he was able to confirm the accuracy of at least one record in the database.</p>

<p>His reaction was very serious. He immediately understood the potential harm that could be done if this database were to end up in the wrong hands. Kidnapping is a considerable problem in Mexico, and allowing cartels to download copies of this database could prove disastrous.</p>

<p>Following the September 11th terrorist attacks, the United States, for whatever reason, acquired a similar database through a data brokerage firm known as ChoicePoint. From what I&rsquo;ve read, ChoicePoint managed to get ahold of the Mexican voter database in exchange for $250,000 back in the early 2000s.</p>

<p>When that story broke, citizens across Mexico were outraged that the US Government had the country&rsquo;s private details. I can only imagine what fury will ensue now that anyone in the entire world could have potentially downloaded it. I mean, I&rsquo;m just some guy in Texas&hellip; and I have it.</p>

It would be bad if a bunch of Bitcoin-holding accounts, and corresponding passwords, were to be exposed to the public.</p>

<p>Well, that&rsquo;s exactly what happened with gambling site Coinroll.com. In March, I discovered a MongoDB, configured for public access, containing details (including password hashes) for 4,610 &ldquo;accounts&rdquo; and 9,668 &ldquo;addresses&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The passwords are hashed using the sha256 algorithm, so they are fairly strong from a security perspective. However, I see no indication of salting (adding random data to further strengthen the hashes).</p>

<p>Without salts on these hashes, many passwords could potentially be uncloaked through comparing the sha256 hash of a common password to the hash present in the database. Please note that I purposely did not crack any of the hashes found in this breach.</p>

<p>Through a PR representative, Juan-Samuel Codina-Fauteux, my breach notification was acknowledged by Coinroll on Wednesday, March 30th, 2016. Then an explanation email arrived on March 31st. Snippets from this communication are pasted below:</p>

<p><em>Well the admins are working on issues. There had been reports of some users getting their balance stolen. Another possible vulnerability was suspected, although nothing definitive. A few users had already been refunded.</em></p>

<p><em>The password are hashed with sha256, so it seems unlikely some accounts were compromised from those hashes alone, if at all. Other patched vulnerability remains the prime suspect.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><em>The issue seems to have arisen with a ubuntu update that overwrote ufw rules from admin, leaving port open. Combined with no password being set for MongoDB, this had disastrous results. This owner that does the sysadmin/dev work admitted he was at fault for such security oversight. Now that this has been closed, he plans moving from Ubuntu to Fedora, converting to docker and audit for other possible oversights.</em></p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><em>Regards,<br />
Juan-Samuel Codina-Fauteux<br />
Marketing &amp; Affiliate Manager</em></p>

<p>I have no concrete clues as to what the &ldquo;Other patched vulnerability&rdquo; could be. I have some theories though, such as the type of MongoDB injection outlined here:&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.technopy.com/mongodb-injection---how-to-hack-mongodb.html"">http://www.technopy.com/mongodb-injection---how-to-hack-mongodb.html</a> ... But that&rsquo;s just speculation on my part.</p>

<p>I believe that the most likely scenario behind any heist of Coinroll Bitcoins is one of two possibilities:&nbsp; Either (1) someone else found that exposed database before I did and compared the sha256 hashes to common passwords; or (2) someone else found the database and used the knowledge of its structure to successfully manipulate login data via MongoDB injection attacks.</p>

<p>Whatever the case, it looks like some Coinroll account holders may be out of luck on their digital currency. Once Bitcoins are transferred to a hacker&rsquo;s wallet, it is likely impossible to recover them. You may be able to track the receiving address and maybe guess at where the funds are going by watching the Bitcoin blockchain. However, any competent attacker will have ways of quickly anonymizing the coins.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s somewhat amusing to realize that users of Bitcoin casinos are gambling in two different ways. First off, as expected, they are gambling on a roll of the dice. However, without realizing it, they are also gambling on whether or not the site&rsquo;s security protocols are sufficient to thwart any would-be attackers.</p>

<p>To their credit, Coinroll did put up a news post on April 11th announcing potential security concerns and a game plan for dealing with the situation. It can be viewed here:&nbsp; <a href=""https://coinroll.com/news"">https://coinroll.com/news</a> .</p>

The reason I&rsquo;m surprised? Well, I discovered a highly similar Verizon breach this last December.</p>

<p>Brian Krebs recently reported on a Verizon data breach here:&nbsp; <a href=""https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/03/crooks-steal-sell-verizon-enterprise-customer-data"">https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/03/crooks-steal-sell-verizon-enterprise-customer-data</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know for sure if the bad guys in the most recent breach actually used an exploit to get the data, but I can tell you that the Verizon MongoDB that I found was completely unprotected by any password or authentication. All you needed in order to access it was a MongoDB client and the IP address.</p>

<p>Discover how MacKeeper protects your online security with <a href=""https://mackeeper.com/security"">Safe Browsing and Antivirus</a>.</p>

<p>The big difference is that the one I discovered was then responsibly disclosed to Verizon. However, it took them a month to plug the hole. It never made the news, but now I wish that I had made a bigger deal out of it. Maybe that would have spurred some changes which could have prevented the breach that Krebs wrote about.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with my initial email to Verizon, which I sent to <a href=""mailto:EmergencyCyberReport@verizon.com"">EmergencyCyberReport@verizon.com</a> on December 22nd, 2015 and titled &ldquo;Urgent data exposure notification&rdquo;:</p>

<p><em>I&#39;ve stumbled upon what appears to be one of your databases. It is currently configured for public access without any sort of password or authentication at all. In reviewing some of the data present, I have come across, for example, secret Verizon encryption and authentication keys (PSKs).</em></p>

<p><em>There are also some access tokens and password hashes for various services and accounts. This database also includes massive amounts of data and metadata for DVR, VOD, and Fios Hydra services.</em></p>

<p><em>If you believe this is indeed your database, I can provide the IP address and port number that you will want to check and secure. Please do respond promptly, as I&#39;m sure Verizon does not wish for this data to remain in the public&#39;s view.</em></p>

<p><em>Sincerely,<br />
Chris Vickery</em></p>

<p>And here is the response I received almost one month later (on January 19th, 2016):</p>

<p><em>Hi Chris,</em></p>

<p><em>It appears that you sent us a find and no one has responded. &nbsp;Please confirm either way &ndash; if you have not been contacted then I would like to introduce myself &ndash; I&rsquo;m the Director of Corporate Cyber Security for Verizon and will be your POC.<br />
I look forward to hearing from you and working with you on your find.</em></p>

<p><em>Jim Matteo<br />
Director<br />
Verizon Corporate Security</em></p>

<p>I sent back a response letting Jim know that I had not heard from Verizon and wasn&rsquo;t even sure if the database was still exposed (it was). I also asked Jim if I had included the IP address in my initial report and if there was anything else they needed from me.</p>

<p>That message prompted the following response from Jim:</p>

<p><em>I think I have everything. Give me a day or 2 to rattle some cages in our IT shop and get this looked at<br />
Thanks for your patience and again I apologize for our confusion over here</em></p>

<p>That evening it occurred to me that I had not actually sent Verizon the IP address of the exposed database in my initial report. I started to wonder if Jim really did have everything. So, I checked to see if the database was still leaking. To my surprise, it was. That&rsquo;s when I fired off another email to Jim:</p>

<p><em>I just checked, and was surprised to see that the database is still exposed. While you&#39;re rattling those cages, you might want to point someone towards IP address [REDACTED] on port 27017 (the default MongoDB port). That&#39;s where the completely open database can be found.&nbsp;Attached is a screenshot that should also help.</em></p>

<p><em>Thanks for getting the ball rolling on this one.</em></p>

<p><em>-Chris</em></p>

<p>The same evening, Jim responded with the following one liner:</p>

<p><em>Thanks for helping us out - even if we&#39;re slow out of the gate. I&#39;ll be back with you shortly&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s where the story went cold for a long time. I had not heard back from Jim until March 28th, 2016 when the Verizon PR staff heard that I was planning to post this article.</p>

<p>I want to be very careful here and make sure that nobody thinks I&rsquo;m disparaging Jim. He has a very intense job and oversees a lot of people and systems, so I&rsquo;m not trying to give the impression that he unfairly brushed me off. I&rsquo;m sure things fall through the cracks all the time at every corporation the size of Verizon.</p>

<p>Jim and I actually had a very nice phone conversation last night. It turns out that the Verizon PR team is claiming that the MongoDB I found was only a test environment with fictitious customer data, non-sensitive reference material, unique encryption keys, and solely used passwords specific to that test environment (<em>i.e.</em> move along, nothing to see here).</p>

<p>So I asked Jim about that PR claim. Jim told me that he never personally had the opportunity to see the database that I found, but the PR people are indeed quoting the official report that had been passed up the chain regarding the incident.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s when I let Jim know that I still have over 50 gigs of data dumped from the MongoDB that I found, and that at least some of the database tables are actually marked as being production (<em>i.e. </em>not test data).</p>

<p>Jim understandably became very interested in the 50+ gigs of Verizon data that I still have. We agreed that it would be best for me to zip it down and securely upload it to him so that Verizon can review it and verify if this database really was just a &ldquo;test environment&rdquo; with no sensitive data. I did so last night.</p>

<p>Readers may be curious as to why I don&rsquo;t necessarily believe Verizon&rsquo;s claims at this point. I mean, if this database really was exposed to the public, then it would make sense that nothing important was in it, right?</p>

<p>Well, the thing is that companies, when caught with their pants down, almost always claim that the exposed data is fictitious, or just a test environment. It&rsquo;s an easy excuse that, if believed, gets them out of a lot of potential embarrassment and liability. I&rsquo;d say that 90% of the breaches I find are initially denied as just &ldquo;test data&rdquo;. But I&rsquo;d also say that the vast majority of those do indeed turn out to be real breaches in the end.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The truth is usually a mix. Much of the time it really is a test environment, however, that test environment has usually been populated with real, production, data. So, in essence, it is a hybrid breach involving real data in an environment that no one was taking seriously. This is a potently dangerous practice that I&rsquo;m finding more and more.</p>

<p>As you can see from the screenshots posted with this article, there was some ominous stuff here. My eyebrows raised when I realized there were password hashes exposed for accounts named &ldquo;VzAppUserRW&rdquo;, &ldquo;VzAdmin&rdquo;, and &ldquo;VzSuperAdmin&rdquo;.</p>

<p>To the victims of Verizon&rsquo;s most recent data breach, I want to say that I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;m sorry that I didn&rsquo;t make a bigger fuss back in December and January when I found the other exposed MongoDB. If I had sounded the alarm on that one, then maybe things would have been tightened down just a bit more and perhaps this latest breach, the one that Brian Krebs is reporting on, wouldn&rsquo;t have happened.</p>

<p>***UPDATE***:&nbsp; After one more conversation with Jim Matteo, from Verizon, I have additional details to report. For starters, I was right about the &ldquo;hybrid breach&rdquo; scenario in this case. It turns out that there was indeed production data here in somewhat of a test environment.</p>

<p>According to Jim, there had been some kind of service disruption in one of Verizon&rsquo;s network services around November 6th, 2015. That&rsquo;s when this test environment was put together and populated with, at least some level of, production data. It was used to troubleshoot and resolve the errors, but then wasn&rsquo;t properly taken down after the problems were fixed. In fact, some Verizon employee, whether intentionally or unintentionally, ended up opening up the database to the entire world. That&rsquo;s when I found it and reported it.</p>

<p>Jim assures me that even if this particular database had been fully leaked to the public, rather than just me discovering it, then no one really would have been harmed. I hope that&rsquo;s the truth and I have no particular reason to disbelieve Jim. Although it still makes me curious if making a bigger deal out of the MongoDB I found would have resulted in tighter security measures surrounding the MongoDB that Krebs has more recently reported as stolen.</p>

<p>In the end I have securely purged all 50 gigs of Verizon data from my storage and notified them as such. I&rsquo;ll also be keeping Jim&rsquo;s cell number handy just in case I find anymore little treasure troves bearing the Verizon logo in the near future.</p>

<p>About three years ago there was an iPhone app named Kinotopic. According to their website, which is still up, &ldquo;Kinotopic allows you to create, share, and store short video moments and make them more expressive &ndash; in the form of animated pictures and cinemagraphs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Past users of Kinotopic may be interested to learn that there is currently a MongoDB database that appears to belong to Kinotopic sitting out on the open internet with no protection whatsoever. This derelict MongoDB instance contains, among other things, the email addresses, usernames, and hashed passwords for, what appear to be, over 198,000 previous Kinotopic users.</p>

<p>I have tried to get in touch with the Kinotopic developers in several ways. All were unsuccessful. For example, the email address given on their website for help and support is <a href=""mailto:help@kinotopic.com"">help@kinotopic.com</a>. But good luck trying to send anything to that email address. It will bounce almost immediately.</p>

<p>Also, I had fun trying to contact Apple about the issue. I figured that Apple might have some way to contact the developers of a prior iPhone app. After all, doesn&rsquo;t it make Apple look bad if an app, that had gained Apple&rsquo;s official seal of approval, then later exposes its user database to the entire world?</p>

<p>When I contacted Apple, they had this to say via email:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Chris, if you believe that this issue affects the security of an iOS device or the iTunes Store, you may report it to product-security@apple.com. [&hellip;]</em></p>

<p><em>On the other hand, if this security issue only affects the application itself, I&rsquo;m afraid you will need to continue getting in touch with the app developer for assistance.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>When that response came back from Apple they already knew that I had hit a dead-end trying to contact the Kinotopic developers. I was expecting a little more assistance in tracking down the makers of this software that was, until recently, officially supported and offered in the iPhone App Store.</p>

<p>So, here&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m at:&nbsp; If anyone reading this post knows of a way to get in contact with the Kinotopic developers (or their database administrators), please drop me a line at <a href=""mailto:cvickery@kromtech.com"">cvickery@kromtech.com</a>. Once I&rsquo;m confident that they are the proper people to speak with, I can provide the exact IP address and port number of the exposed database. A semi-redacted overview screenshot of the database should be visible above this post. If that is your database, I want to talk with you.</p>

<p>And to anyone that may have used Kinotopic in the past&mdash; It&rsquo;s probably time to cycle in some new passwords to your mix.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-ransomware-idUSKCN0W80VX"">The news</a> about the first fully functional ransomware targeting OS X users has become an over-hyped subject on the web. According to <em>Palo Alto Networks</em>, last weekend hackers managed to infect the open source Transmission BitTorrent app with something called &#39;KeRanger&#39;.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""https://mackeeper.com/blog/category/10"">Chris Vickery, MacKeeper Security Researcher</a>, <em>&ldquo;ransomware that targets Apple devices was bound to appear sooner or later. Сriminals behind this campaign are likely to be testing the waters to see how profitable an Apple-centric ransomware attack can be. A lot of effort was put into this, and they had to burn some valuable assets (e.g. a rogue certificate). Personally, I don&#39;t think this campaign will prove to be very profitable for the bad guys, but the public relations damages for Apple and the Transmission team will likely be large.&quot; </em></p>

<p>Mac users have become not so vulnerable as suggested by media, especially as compared to PC users. Apple has reacted promptly and withdrawn the security certificate within hours. Now anybody who tries to open the harmful application gets the warning message: &ldquo;Transmission.app will damage your computer. You should move it to the Trash.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>

<p>However, there are still a lot of exaggerated claims about the &ldquo;ransomware&rdquo; threat. There&rsquo;s a tiny chance that your Mac has been infected. If you do not use Transmission, you can stop reading at this point. Otherwise, we&rsquo;ve got several tips on how you can stay completely safe even after downloading Transmission.</p>

<p>Discover <a href=""https://mackeeper.com/privacy"">MacKeeper Privacy Protection</a> and <a href=""https://mackeeper.com/security"">Online &amp; Offline Security Protection tools</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The Backstory</strong></p>

<p>Currently, it&rsquo;s not entirely clear how the hackers managed to replace original Transmission installers with their compromised copies. Anyway, we know that KeRanger bypasses Apple&rsquo;s Gatekeeper and is capable of encrypting important files, e.g. Time Machine backups making them unavailable for original owner.</p>

<p>Once installed, the ransomware remains inactive for three days and then connects to the remote command and control servers by using the Tor network. At the same time, the malware starts the encryption process, which is targeted at important documents and files on the hard drive. When the encryption is over, the user gets a notification urging to pay one bitcoin (approx. $400) to get the sensitive data back.</p>

<p>Transmission Project has already removed the compromised installers from its website whereas Apple has updated its antivirus signatures and cancelled the unsafe certificates to make sure that nobody gets infected again.</p>

<p><strong>What You Can Do</strong></p>

<p>If you use MacKeeper and have Transmission installed on your Mac, make sure you check out the Update Tracker tool for the newer build of Transmission v.2.92.</p>

<p>Palo Alto Networks strongly suggests that all Transmission BitTorrent app users should check whether their Macs have been infected with the aforementioned ransomware. We strongly recommend following the steps below.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Use the Finder or Terminal to determine whether any of the paths exist:</strong></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><em>/Applications/Transmission.app/Contents/Resources/ General.rtf or /Volumes/Transmission/Transmission.app/Contents/Resources/ General.rtf exist.</em></p>

<p>If you find any of the abovementioned paths, delete the Transmission application as soon as possible.</p>

<p>2. <strong>Open the Activity Monitor utility and check if any process called &ldquo;kernel_service&rdquo; is running. </strong></p>

<p>Double check each process, click <em>&ldquo;Open Files and Ports&rdquo;</em> and make sure that you <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> see <em>&ldquo;/Users/&lt;username&gt;/Library/kernel_service&rdquo;</em>. That&rsquo;s the main process of KeRanger, so in case you have it running, choose <em>&ldquo;Quit &gt; Force Quit&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Check the <em>&ldquo;.kernel_pid&rdquo;,</em> <em>&ldquo;.kernel_time&rdquo;</em>, <em>&ldquo;.kernel_complete&rdquo;,</em> and <em>&ldquo;kernel_service&rdquo;</em> files in the <em>~/Library</em> folder. If you locate any of these, delete them.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>In violation of the Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), uKnowKids.com gave public access to over 6.8 million private text messages, nearly 2 million images (many depicting children), and more than 1,700 detailed child profiles. This includes first and last names, email addresses, dates of birth, gps coordinates, social media access credentials, and more.</p>

<p>The uKnowKids child tracking platform claims to make &ldquo;Parenting Easier, and Keeps Kids Safe Online.&rdquo; However, earlier this month I discovered they were doing just the opposite. One of the uKnowKids databases was configured for public access, requiring no level of authentication or password and providing no protection at all for this data.</p>

<p>Find out how <a href=""https://mackeeper.com/security"">MacKeeper helps to keep you protected online and offline</a>.</p>

<p>COPPA requires that a service such as uKnowKids.com &ldquo;establish and maintain reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of personal information collected from children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I would consider it not a &ldquo;reasonable procedure&rdquo; to give the public open, unfettered access to a database containing detailed child information. I know that uKnowKids.com is bound by COPPA because their CEO, Steve Woda, told me so in a telephone conversation.</p>

<p>In fact, during that very same phone call, Steve Woda tried all manner of intimidation tactics against me. I can only assume that this is because he doesn&rsquo;t want anyone reporting on the incident. Woda repeatedly insisted that I have acted inappropriately in my response to discovering and alerting his company to the gaping breach.</p>

<p>Furthermore, he tried to convince me that an outlet reporting on the breach could face liability under COPPA (a claim which is, of course, preposterous).</p>

<p>I was a bit surprised by Steve&rsquo;s tone during that February 18th phone conversation. Just the previous day, he had sent me email messages such as the following:</p>

<p><em>Thank you again for alerting me to the data security breach that you discovered. I am super sensitive to ANY and EVERY security vulnerability (and in this case, breach), and so I am very, very thankful for your note [&hellip;]</em></p>

<p>And:</p>

<p><em>[&hellip;] you could easily put us out of business if we are not provided the opportunity to comprehensively deal with this appropriately [&hellip;]</em></p>

<p>I have no interest in putting uKnowKids &ldquo;out of business&rdquo;. However, I do not appreciate it when someone is nice and agreeable in emails and then issues veiled threats over the phone.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no way for me to know for sure how long this data was exposed to the public internet, although the information collected by Shodan.io suggests that the database had been up for at least 48 days. There&rsquo;s also no way for me to know for sure how many people may have accessed the database during the exposed timeframe.</p>

<p>The lesson to learn here is that, if you&rsquo;re a parent, be wary of services that offer to monitor your child&rsquo;s online behavior. These services collect unnerving amounts of data on your child and, when a breach occurs, all of that data can be exposed to untold numbers of people.</p>

<p>Also, if you ever decide to do-the-right-thing and notify a company that they are leaking data, try to keep all correspondence in written format. I&rsquo;ve found that CEOs are much less willing to mind their manners in telephone conversations.</p>

<p>Punchkick Interactive is a mobile web development company. Microsoft relies on Punchkick to handle the database that powers m.careersatmicrosoft.com. The bad news is that, for at least the past few weeks, this backend database has been exposed to the open internet and required no authentication at all to access.</p>

<p>The good news is that as of February 5th, following my disclosure of the vulnerability to Punchkick and Microsoft, everything has been secured. For those curious, there is an overview screenshot of the database in its exposed form included with this post. You&rsquo;ll notice some other company names in the image, but I focused on Microsoft due to the probability of that portion having the most impact.</p>

<p>All indications are that the database, a MongoDB instance, was not write-protected. You probably see where this is going-- During the exposed timeframe, an attacker could have modified the database, and thus, the HTML code of job listing pages being served through m.careersatmicrosoft.com.</p>

<p>The ability to craft arbitrary HTML into an official Microsoft careers webpage is, to say the least, a powerful find for a would-be malicious hacker. This situation is the classic definition of a potential watering hole attack.</p>

<p>In that scenario, any number of browser exploits could be launched against unsuspecting job-seekers. It would also be a fantastic phishing opportunity, as people seeking jobs at Microsoft probably tend to have higher value credentials.</p>

<p>Speaking of credentials, some of those were part of this exposed Punchkick database. As proof of the severity of the situation, one of my early emails to Microsoft regarding the vulnerability included a screenshot showing the name, email address, password hash, and issued tokens for Microsoft&rsquo;s Global Employment Brand Marketing Manager, Karrie Shepro. A redacted version of the screenshot is posted along with this article.</p>

<p>My main point of contact at Punchkick Interactive was Charles Portwood. The most recent message I received from him contained, in part, the following:</p>

<p><em>The Mongo database is ours, but is used for a separate service that is ultimately consumed by the m.careersatmicrosoft.com website. This issue which caused the MongoDB to be exposed publicly has been fixed on our end.</em></p>

<p><em>Thanks for reporting to this us so that we could quickly correct it.</em></p>

<p><em>Charles R. Portwood II | Punchkick Interactive</em></p>

<p>He is right about Punchick &ldquo;quickly&rdquo; correcting it. I believe there was only one hour between my first email to hello@punchkick.com and the database being secured. Punchkick gets points in my book for the quick turnaround, strong password hashing, and generally being very nice. This was an example of excellent incident response.</p>

<p>The lesson to learn here is that if you&rsquo;re a big name player like Microsoft, it&rsquo;s acceptable for third-parties to handle mundane operations like job posting webpages. But be aware that a hole in the third-party&rsquo;s security can quickly become a hole in your security.</p>

Let&rsquo;s talk about one&nbsp; of the secret techniques sometimes used by hackers to host malicious code and evade detection.</p>

<p>The secret is that thousands of unprotected printer hard drives are laying exposed on the Internet. That&rsquo;s right, your office&rsquo;s big HP printer probably has many gigs of internal storage space, and, if you don&rsquo;t protect port 9100, you&rsquo;re basically handing an anonymous FTP server to the hacker community.</p>

<p>There are a few free, open source pieces of software that can be used to upload and interact with HP printer hard drives over port 9100. After uploading to a printer, the file can be accessed by visiting http:///hp/device/ with any web browser.</p>

<p>This opens up a world of possibilities. A hacker can host malicious web pages and scripts on your printer and link it to potential victims. Maybe he needs to host an executable somewhere so it can later be served through a wget request. These printers are wonderful repositories. It doesn&rsquo;t take much creativity to realize that even highly illegal materials could be stored this way.</p>

<p>After all, this kind of printer is usually powered up and online twenty-four hours a day. Even in sleep mode it will still host files. And who checks the contents of their printer&rsquo;s hard drive? What are the odds of this hacker&rsquo;s secret stash ever being discovered? Pretty low if you ask me.</p>

<p>Then you also have to consider that any organization leaving their printers exposed to the internet probably doesn&rsquo;t have the greatest, if any, logging system in place. The chances of being caught are extremely low for the malicious actor.</p>

<p>Naturally, you may be wondering why I am highlighting this problem. Won&rsquo;t it just help amateur hackers elevate their game? Disclosing vulnerabilities will always be a double-edged blade. Sure, some people will take advantage of the information, but it&rsquo;s my sincere belief that anyone seeking tips on how to protect themselves should also be made aware.</p>

<p>So, if you&rsquo;re concerned about security, put your printers are behind a firewall and, if it&rsquo;s a Hewlett-Packard, make sure port 9100 isn&rsquo;t open.</p>

<p>Followers of data breach news will recall the early December hack of music sales site Tunecore as well as more recent coverage of a SQL injection attack against a band known as Faithless.</p>

<p>But unlike the Tunecore and Faithless incidents, this Earbits situation does not involve a hack at all. I discovered the 325k user database through a regular review of search results on the site Shodan.io. The Earbits database was not using any authentication measures. It was completely exposed and available to anyone in the entire world with an Internet connection.</p>

<p>We&#39;re talking about everything from real names, email addresses, and SHA1 password hashes (with accompanying salts), to the secret access keys of Earbits&#39; Amazon S3 account.</p>

<p>I fired off alerts to the two Earbits email addresses I could locate, as well as a few messages to their parent company, You42. Attempting to call You42 proved fruitless, as the only options were a dial-by-name directory and an operator line that went straight to voicemail.</p>

<p>Below is the exact message I sent to Earbits and You42:</p>

<p><em>Hello Earbits,</em></p>

<p><em>I have come across a database that appears to belong to you. It is currently configured for public access and does not require any form of password or authentication to view. The database contains, among other things, the account details for over 325,000 of your users. This includes email addresses, password hashes, and IPs.</em></p>

<p><em>To show that this is not a hoax, I have attached a screenshot overview of the database. If this is indeed your data, please contact me as soon as possible so that I can provide you with the IP address and port number of the exposed database.</em></p>

<p><em>Please be advised that any response, or lack of response, is likely to be included in my reporting of the incident.</em></p>

<p><em>Sincerely,<br />
Chris Vickery</em></p>

<p>A few hours later I received the following response:</p>

<p><em>Hi Chris,</em></p>

<p><em>We received your notifications regarding the potential security issue with our database. Can you provide us with the IP address and port of the exposed database along with the methods you used to uncover this issue so we can address this security flaw immediately.</em></p>

<p><em>Much appreciated!</em></p>

<p><em>Sincerely,<br />
Khang</em></p>

<p>--&nbsp;<br />
<em>Engineering @ Earbits</em></p>

<p>I responded with the IP address and port number corresponding to the exposed database. I also immediately checked to see if the data was still accessible. It was not. That leads me to believe that Earbits was able to locate the exposed data using only the description and screenshot included with my original notification email. Although, it must have been nice to receive confirmation from me that they had found and plugged the correct hole.</p>

<p>At this point, it is unknown how long the database remained exposed to the world and whether Earbits will be notifying its users of the breach. It would be a good idea for all Earbits users to change their password for the site and their password on any other site that may have used the same password.</p>

<p>All in all, this was a pretty good post-notification response time by Earbits, especially considering that I sent the notification emails on a US holiday (Martin Luther King Jr. Day). They also get points for implementing salted password hashes. While not completely effective against password hash cracking techniques, salting hashes does slow things down, as it renders rainbow tables ineffective.</p>

Chris Vickery had previously reported a misconfigured database containing the personal information of over 191 million voters. Vickery also found the unprotected data and customer records of Hello Kitty, MLB, ATP and Slipknot official online communities.</p>

<p><strong>Tell us a little bit about some of your most recent findings.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Well, the most recent big one was finding the voter registration records of 191 million registered US voters. A lot of people say, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s public record,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s not so black-and-white or clear as that. A lot of states restrict what you can give out and who you can give it to and they say you can make it available to everyone outside the United States. And this database was totally available to anybody, instantly, all around the world, so there is a line that was crossed there.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>So, what one could somebody do with that data?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>I think the easiest way to explain what you could do - because there&rsquo;s name, phone number, and date of birth, along with address and other voter demographic data - is that you could take the date of birth and you could focus on people that are, say, over 60 or over 70. And you can use the common scams that are used against old people, because you&rsquo;ve already got all their phone numbers, you&rsquo;ve already got the targeted list. You don&rsquo;t have to hit false positives and all that technologies that are used against the young people. No, if you are targeting old people, you go straight to them. And if you can bind it with something like let&rsquo;s say the Ashley Madison database breach, you have all sorts of metrics to target people. Because email address is part of that. Not everybody has the email address, but some people do on the registration. So you can tie somebody&rsquo;s name, address, phone number, date of birth to the Ashley Madison database, and all of a sudden you&rsquo;ve got cross-references to do all sorts of extortions.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Were you contacted by FBI, CIA, or Homeland Security?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>That&rsquo;s actually one thing I cannot discuss at all. I am working with at least one federal agency in regards to that, but I can&rsquo;t say what is the organization or its name or anything like that.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>And with some of the other discoveries... Give us an example. Slipknot is there, Hello Kitty is there. When you found this information, you didn&#39;t know what company&rsquo;s database it was until you researched it, right?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Not immediately, it&rsquo;s not always apparent whose data it is. You do a little bit of legwork, you look at what the data is, you look at the IP address, if it&rsquo;s hosted in the Amazon cloud instance it&rsquo;s not so obvious, because there&rsquo;s no straight and narrow DNS records. But sometimes it&rsquo;s hosted on an email server. I think iFit was an example, they were hosting it on an email server or something like that, so it was an automatic DNS lookup that told me who it was. Sometimes you have to look at the data itself, look at the contact information and kind of call them and ask them if the IP belongs to them, and a lot of times they&rsquo;ll confirm that it&rsquo;s theirs.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How did you get started doing this? Tell us about you IT background, what got you into that and how you started looking for vulnerabilities in databases.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve always had a knack for computers and technology. It&rsquo;s all my life. For the last 5 years I worked in IT tech support in a law firm, and really the earliest data breach research was a little bit before September of 2015. I came across an open Amazon bucket for the company named Systema Software. They do house private insurance and medical diagnoses and all sorts of call records and everything for various state and government agencies. It was just pure luck that I came across that. I was just looking in random Amazon S3 buckets not looking for anything in particular, and I came across that one and realized that it was something important. It made a big news splash and ever since then I&rsquo;ve just kept and eye on.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Well, that&rsquo;s really sensitive data because of medical privacy laws, so how did you deal with that? With the second you realized what you had, what did you do with that?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>I figured out the affected entities, the state of Kansas was one of them. They had their entire workers database up there, social security numbers and everything. I contacted the state of Kansas and verified that it was their data. After a while, I was contacting other agencies, I got in contact with the Texas Attorney General&rsquo;s office, because there were Texas people in some of the databases, so I figured out that local law enforcement was involved.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>That&rsquo;s really crazy to think about how many databases are vulnerable. How many today have you found?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>I&rsquo;ve probably come across about 80 open, not necessarily vulnerable, but just unauthenticated, totally available, being published in entire world databases that should not be published in that way.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Now, if you were going to give advice to, let&rsquo;s say, an IT guy who is responsible for that database, what advice would you give them to troubleshoot or discover the type of vulnerabilities that you find?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The easiest way to explain that is assign a little bit of overtime to somebody in your IT department who knows your IP addresses, who knows what servers you host your important stuff on. Get them to go home and try to access it from their home PC. That&rsquo;s really simple, really easy, and that will find almost 100% of the vulnerabilities that I find. And just if you can reach it from your home, anybody in the world can reach it. If these companies would do that, they&rsquo;d catch it. There&rsquo;s nothing complex or advanced.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>So, we all know that was MacKeeper, you&rsquo;ve discovered. Tell me the process when you discovered the MacKeeper accounts and walk me through the timeline, including up to now.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t remember the exact date it was. I came across using Shodan, a search engine that searches for devices and things that Google doesn&rsquo;t search for. I came across an interesting-looking database that had the word &ldquo;ZeoBIT&rdquo; in it. I had never heard about ZeoBIT before, so I looked into it and realized this was account information belonging to somebody, and I saw all sorts of references to MacKeeper, so I googled what MacKeeper was, and Kromtech and MacKeeper showed up. I found a phone number on the MacKeeper website and tried calling it. Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t know what the exact situation was, but I wasn&#39;t able to get to a real person. So, I reached out the Apple subforum on Reddit, and said: &ldquo;Hey, I&#39;ve downloaded the information of X million people, can somebody help me get a hold of these Kromtech or MacKeeper people so we can get this secured. And I let everybody know that I was not gonna be leaking it or spreading it around. A little bit later MacKeeper contacted me and asked what was the IP address, what was the port number and they were very nice about it, and I provided it to them and found a couple more IP&rsquo;s that were also exposed, they got them locked down pretty fast. Then they asked me if I wanted to start consulting with them security-wise. After a few days later I got a call from you, and I said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m very interested in exploring.&rdquo; You know, it&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;ve done really professionally before, but I do have a knack for it, so why not? And then I got an email a few days after that, inviting me to CES to meet up with the MacKeeper people. And it&rsquo;s been fantastic! The response was good, they were very nice to me, they didn&rsquo;t call me a hacker or anything, so that was very, very refreshing. And as far as I know they&rsquo;ve upgraded the password algorithms that they are using to store user passwords now, so they&rsquo;re not easily crackable, and they&rsquo;re taking many corrective steps to make sure that it won&rsquo;t happen again.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What do you think about CES? You know, coming from your tech background. It&rsquo;s your first year here, first time in Vegas. What do you think, seeing this much technology, seeing these many new innovations, there&rsquo;s a lot of security stuff here as well... What is your general impression?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>It&rsquo;s pretty crazy. The amount of people here, and companies showcasing... it&rsquo;s overwhelming, with so many people here and so many signs and glowing letters everywhere. I mean, it&rsquo;s not overwhelming necessarily, but it is impressive.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

1,2017-03-03T00:00:00.000Z,Extensive Breach at Intl Airport ...,extensive-breach-at-intl-airport2,post_ead21eaa58acd5acfd5d4cd2335ae4c9.jpg,58a1eb976573f71894491fc1,MacKeeper Security Research Center,1,2017-03-20T15:36:13.099Z,2017-03-03T15:42:53.795Z,https://mackeeper.com/blog/post/334-extensive-breach-at-intl-airport,0,Extensive Breach at Intl Airport ...,,,"<p>In what should be considered a complete compromise of network integrity, New York&rsquo;s Stewart International Airport was recently found exposing 760 gigs of backup data to the public internet. No password. No username. No authentication whatsoever.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The leaky data set includes everything from sensitive TSA letters of investigation to employee social security numbers, network passwords, and 107 gigabytes of email correspondence. Until I notified the facility&rsquo;s management this past Tuesday, there existed a real risk to the security and safety of this US airport.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/367cf5193ec77a84736f5da7045d822758affa6d7085b.png"" style=""height:532px; width:700px"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">This is an important case study in how business practices can result in data breaches. According to the materials present, the Port Authority of New York &amp; New Jersey contracts out management of Stewart International to a private company named AvPORTS. That company then contracts with a sole IT guy that is only on site two or three times per month.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/9c4bd9f7aefb1f8c3289516c3be2ae4058affa6e8a2a6.png"" style=""height:395px; width:700px"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">You cannot expect one person to maintain an airport network infrastructure. Doing so is a recipe for security lapses. This is a classic example of what can go wrong with privatization. For-profit companies have every incentive to, all too often, prioritize revenue over best practices.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">This is emphasized by the AvPORTS incident response performance. In an industry at the level of airport management, every employee needs to have at least cursory data breach readiness training. The first person I spoke with at AvPORTS was very nice to me, but at one point asked me if this &ldquo;could wait until tomorrow&rdquo;.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The answer to that question is no. When your company is leaking government-created documents with phrases such as &ldquo;Confidential&rdquo;, &ldquo;For Official Use Only&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Unauthorized release may result in civil penalty or other action&rdquo;, you cannot simply wait until tomorrow. It requires immediate action.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/59a2325501112152df34540afb5472b758affa6e59619.png"" style=""height:640px; width:700px"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Initial Response</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">I was somewhat relieved when an AvPORTS COO did call me back a few minutes later, around 12pm Pacific US time. He assured me that I would be hearing from their IT staff shortly to further investigate and remedy the situation.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Three and a half hours later I had not heard back from anyone and the data breach was still live. I decided to call the Port Authority. They instructed me to call the Stewart terminal and provided a phone number. During that next call, to the terminal operators, the server&rsquo;s exposed port was closed off to the outside world. It&rsquo;s unknown whether or not this was coincidental timing, as the terminal guys claimed that their department cannot make such a change.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>The IT Guy</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">A few hours later, around 7pm Pacific, I finally received a call from the IT guy. The conversation took an initial downturn. He informed me that I had committed a crime by downloading this data and used the analogy of breaking in and stealing items from someone&rsquo;s home (which could not be further from the truth).</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Fortunately, the conversation evened out when I explained to him that my actions were in no way criminal. The device had been configured in a manner which was distributing these files publicly without a single username, password, or other authentication measure in place. Regardless of intention, this machine was, in essence, acting as a public web server.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Possible Explanations</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">So, how did this happen? Here are some clues-- The IT guy I spoke with informed me that a few months ago the airport had experimented with using a backup software known as ShadowProtect. I was informed that part of the process involved opening port 873 on the firewall and that the ShadowStream service, part of ShadowProtect, may have been utilizing some aspect of the remote synchronization service (rsync). This is just what I was told in that conversation.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">That may be a bit of a red herring though and only part of the puzzle. Within the backups I was able to locate an email chain indicating that AvPORTS purchased at least one Buffalo Terastation backup NAS device in March of 2016.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Those of you that keep up with my work may recall this same make and model of NAS device being at the center of a recently reported Ameriprise Financial data breach. In fact, I have made several other recent breach findings involving this particular device.</p>

<p>My hypothesis is that there may be a default opening of port 873 on some number of Buffalo Terastations. Keep in mind that port 873 had been intentionally opened on Stewart International&rsquo;s firewall during part of the experiment with ShadowProtect.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The current working theory is that these two factors aligned and resulted in a breach scenario. But all of this begs the question: Would such an oversight happen if AvPORTS employed even one full-time IT guy at Stewart?</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">You get what you pay for, even in IT.</p>

1,2017-03-09T00:00:00.000Z,Spammergate: The Fall of an Empire,spammergate-the-fall-of-an-empire,post_ccbc5d71347a87416df2931823ce3549.jpg,58b0418af6069dec3a951054,Chris Vickery ,0,2017-04-04T09:02:41.111Z,2017-03-09T12:59:32.891Z,,true,"Today we release details on the innerworkings of a massive, illegal spam operation. The situation presents a tangible threat to online privacy and security as it involves a database of 1.4 billion email accounts combined with real names, user IP addresses, and often physical address. Chances are that you, or at least someone you know, is affected.",,,"<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/7840babff49254722c95c21150bb75c558b99ed74f119.png"" style=""height:419px; width:700px"" /></p>

<p>A cooperative team of investigators from the MacKeeper Security Research Center, CSOOnline, and Spamhaus came together in January after I stumbled upon a suspicious, yet publicly exposed, collection of files. Someone had forgotten to put a password on this repository and, as a result, one of the biggest spam empires is now falling.</p>

<p>Additional coverage can be seen over at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.csoonline.com/article/3176433/security/spammers-expose-their-entire-operation-though-bad-backups.html"">CSOOnline</a>.</p>

<p>The leaky files, it turns out, represent the backbone operations of a group calling themselves River City Media (RCM). Led by known spammers Alvin Slocombe and Matt Ferris, RCM masquerades as a legitimate marketing firm while, per their own documentation, being responsible for up to a billion daily email sends.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/c1e1261d0808b9199d95490125c2630158b99f37b3109.png"" style=""height:523px; width:700px"" /></p>

<p>Think about that for a second. How can a group of about a dozen people be responsible for one billion emails sent in one day? The answer is a lot of automation, years of research, and fair bit of illegal hacking techniques.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I say illegal hacking due to the presence of scripts and logs enumerating the groups&rsquo; many missions to probe and exploit vulnerable mail servers. The following chat log, found among the backups, is just one example of River City Media crew members admitting to exploitive behavior.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/9179614ac47a3f6accce56a0277ccc2d58b99f0fa0ddd.png"" />In that screenshot, a RCM co-conspirator describes a technique in which the spammer seeks to open as many connections as possible between themselves and a Gmail server. This is done by purposefully configuring your own machine to send response packets extremely slowly, and in a fragmented manner, while constantly requesting more connections.</p>

<p>Then, when the Gmail server is almost ready to give up and drop all connections, the spammer suddenly sends as many emails as possible through the pile of connection tunnels. The receiving side is then overwhelmed with data and will quickly block the sender, but not before processing a large load of emails.</p>

<p>Purposely throttling your own machinery to amass open connections on someone else&rsquo;s server is a type of Slowloris attack [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowloris_(computer_security)]. The twist here is that the spammer is not trying to completely disable the receiving server, he is only temporarily stressing the resources in order to overwhelm and force the processing of bulk email.</p>

<p>Details of the even more abusive scripts and techniques have been forwarded on to Microsoft, Apple, and others. Law enforcement have also been notified and, while we are prohibited from saying too much, they are indeed interested in the matter.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><u>1.4 Billion</u></p>

<p>Through offers such as credit checks, education opportunities, and sweepstakes, this spam operation has gathered and conglomerated a database of 1.4 billion peoples&rsquo; email accounts, full names, IP addresses, and often physical address. There is evidence that similar organizations have contributed to this collection. An active market exists for trafficking in these types of lists for illegitimate purposes.</p>

<p>Imagine the privacy and legal implications here. Law enforcement agents normally have to go through a subpoena process before a service provider will hand over the name behind an IP address or account. This list maps out 1.4 billion.</p>

<p>The natural response is to question whether the data set is real. That was my initial reaction. I&rsquo;m still struggling with the best software solution to handle such a voluminous collection, but I have looked up several people that I know and the entries are accurate. The only saving grace is that some are outdated by a few years and the subject no longer lives at the same location.</p>

<p>Random selections also consistently appear to reflect real people. Investigating names from the list, through social media and work websites, usually shows that the additional details in the entry are most likely accurate. However, it&rsquo;s not so verifiable that a common web scraper could have easily gathered all the data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well-informed individuals did not choose to sign up for bulk advertisements over a billion times. The most likely scenario is a combination of techniques. One is called co-registration. That&rsquo;s when you click on the &ldquo;Submit&rdquo; or &ldquo;I agree&rdquo; box next to all the small text on a website. Without knowing it, you have potentially agreed your personal details can be shared with affiliates of the site.</p>

<p>You are never told who the affiliates are and groups like River City Media capitalize on that aspect. One line of the leaked chat logs explains it all very succinctly:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The key is sincerity.&nbsp; Once you can fake that...&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keep that line in mind if there is an official response from Alvin Slocombe, Matt Ferris, or one of the other River City Media crew members.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As of this morning, Spamhaus will be blacklisting RCM&rsquo;s entire infrastructure.</p>

<p>Alvin:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.spamhaus.org/rokso/spammer/SPM1247/alvin-slocombe-cyber-world-internet-services"">https://www.spamhaus.org/rokso/spammer/SPM1247/alvin-slocombe-cyber-world-internet-services</a>&nbsp;</p>

Until my notification on March 18th, a file repository through a well known cloud storage provider was completely exposed to the public internet.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Upon further research we found a trove of data from a range of North Carolina government offices, including Dept of Administration, Dept of Health and Human Services, Division of Medical Assistance, Dept of Cultural Resources, Dept of Public Safety, Office of State Controller, Office of State Budget and Management, NC IT Department.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><img alt="""" src=""//static.mackeepersecurity.com/image/upload/tmp_454d28fb8413f3bb3670ebc9450b758e.png"" style=""float:left; height:640px; width:900px"" />Within the cloud repository exists a vast array of sensitive as well as non-sensitive data, including &ldquo;For Official Use Only&rdquo; Department of Homeland Security documentation. The irony of the situation is also worth noting, as some of the exposed documents discuss a current North Carolina initiative to move government files out of insecure cloud situations.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""//static.mackeepersecurity.com/image/upload/tmp_7772fbb460e30c0d01a1484f08414b18.png"" style=""float:left; height:634px; width:900px"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad to see any government agency make an attempt at minimizing the casual use of less-secure cloud applications, but there&rsquo;s something to be said for leading the charge and setting an example. Having a careless data breach within your own IT department is devastating to morale. The damage is not worth cutting corners.</p>

<p>Some of you are probably wondering why I would even write this post. It will only cause further problems for North Carolina, right? Well, I struggled with that question in my head for a little while, and I might have decided to let this one slide without a drawn-out blog post. The deciding factor for me came down to incident response, or a lack thereof.</p>

<p>While North Carolina&rsquo;s IT department fixed the issue overnight on the 18th by disabling access to the repository, following my notification, but they have not at any point attempted to contact me. A well-thought-out incident response plan should include contacting the breach discoverer.</p>

<p>For example, I may have been able to suggest that they contact Google and have certain cached documents taken down from the search engine&rsquo;s results. They could have enquired as to how I found the open repository, or what I downloaded, or even if I still have any of the data. Those are all very important questions that should be covered by any data breach response team.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t let embarrassment stop you from doing a proper breach investigation. You must own up to your mistakes, fix the problem, and be honest with yourself, your staff, and the public.</p>

<p>All those repositories were discovered as a result of a simple Google search and are still cached/available. In order to avoid that a webmaster should have created a robots.txt in root directory.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">I&rsquo;ll leave you with the North Carolina &ldquo;Cyber Security Pledge&rdquo; (it was found within the breach documents).</p>

<p><u>Background:</u></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Nearly every state in the US has some type of data breach notification law on the books. North Carolina is just one of the forty-seven states, including the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands that require private or government entities to notify individuals of a security breach or data leak. Kromtech Security Researchers discovered what appears to be a statewide breach that possibility included sensitive data from nearly every major branch of North Carolina&rsquo;s State Government.</p>

<p>According to the State Attorney General&rsquo;s Office a &ldquo;security breach&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;the unauthorized release of unencrypted or unredacted records or data containing personal information with corresponding names, such as a person&rsquo;s first initial and last name&rdquo;. There are also strict requirements on notifying citizens or individuals who were affected by the breach. Based on the initial assessments of how many agencies were listed in the discovery it could have potentially included a vast majority of North Carolina&rsquo;s citizens. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">This is not the first cyber security wakeup call for the state in the last several months. In July 2016 North Carolina State University officials announced that an email account containing personal information of about 38,000 people was illegally accessed and it occurred &quot;through a sophisticated phishing scam.&quot; Unlike the North Carolina State University incident this discovery was not password protected and serves as a another warning for states, colleges, and companies to audit and test their security practices regularly.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The initial discovery was made in May 2016, since then researchers sent multiple data breach notices to all levels of contacts inside the company that were completely ignored. The database remained open and fully exposed for months with thousands of emails, addresses details, phone numbers, passwords to their internal Avon accounts, identification data, and even partial links to the scanned copies of documents.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">In January 2017 nearly every publically accessible MongoDB database had their data wiped out and replaced with a ransom message claiming that owners of the hacked database need to pay 0.2 Bitcoin ( about $200) into a Bitcoin wallet and they would have their data returned. It is unclear if anyone actually got their data back once they made the payment and no company would admit to paying a ransom for obvious reasons. The ransomware deleted data from as many as 33,000 thousand databases according to some estimates.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Kromtech Researchers believe Avon&rsquo;s Brazil data was most likely compromised in the ransomware attack and this would most likely mean that cyber criminals had access to thousands of credit card numbers, scanned ID cards, IP Addresses and much more. It also is unclear if Avon&rsquo;s Brazil office notified any of the 629,295 people potentially affected by the data leak or the assumed ransomware attack. Currently, Brazil does not have a single statute establishing data protection framework and has been working on drafting a data protection law since 2010. Having weak security or a misconfigured database is bad enough, but ignoring multiple notices with screenshots and other proof is irresponsible and risking customer data. The breach did not appear to affect Avon&rsquo;s US customers or any other territory except Brazil.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Avon is a household name in the United States and beyond and is best known by their direct selling approach of beauty products and household goods. It is the fifth-largest beauty company and, with 6.4 million representatives. Avon sells products in over 100 countries, but what happens when customer data of one of these countries is stored improperly? &nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Avon is based in the United States, but since 2010 Brazil is the company&#39;s largest market.</p>

<p>MacKeeper Security Research Center Discovers Medical Record Leak: 150,000+ Patient Names, Records Diagnoses and Treatment Available Online.</p>

<p>Discover how <a href=""https://mackeeper.com/privacy"">MacKeeper helps to keep your personal data safe</a> from prying eyes.</p>

<p>Medical records contain all information relating to a patient&#39;s medical condition. In the old days medical records were a paper folder stored at the Doctor&rsquo;s office. The records were relatively safe and secure because they were locked away in a storage room and only a small number of people would have access to them. Now anyone with an internet connection can potentially access the sensitive information of a massive number of Americans.</p>

<p>The MacKeeper Security Research Center experts have discovered the open and unsecured databases of the Electronic Medical Record by management companies Carebox and HealthELT. The databases contain the private medical data of more than 150,000&nbsp;patients and were not encrypted or password protected. US Federal Law prohibits publicly sharing medical records under HIPAA that allows access to medical records and to keep that information private.</p>

<p><strong>HealthELT</strong> according to their website is a &ldquo;Startup That Focuses On Medicaid Engagement, Logistics, And Technology Services&rdquo;. To be fair, their database was secured and closed before we could contact them about the leak.</p>

<p>Clayton Gulick, CTO of HealthELT, replied to the notification email:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;We discovered this last week and closed it down, it was just a misconfigured dev database with test data, no sensitive data was leaked. Thanks again for notifying us!!&rdquo;</em><em> </em></p>

<p>***The screenshot clearly shows Social Security numbers and other sensitive medical data.</p>

<p><strong>Carebox&rsquo;s</strong> website says <em>&ldquo;We believe that Carebox will accelerate an inevitable transformation in how patient clinical data is collected, organized, and used&hellip; and we think the potential implications of that are incredible for consumers, life sciences, providers, payers, and employers!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>By the time of publication Carebox did not respond to the notification email, but their database is now secured.</p>

<p>For cost and convenience medical professionals all agree that the future of Medical Records are Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). The benefit of EMRs are that they can be tracked and available at a moment&rsquo;s notice to any medical provider. However, this also makes Electronic Medical Records vulnerable to data leaks or being exposed online if they are not properly secured and protected. This is yet another lesson of how important it is to secure and encrypt the private data of customers and users of any digital service provider.</p>

<p>Medical Record Storage is a vital concern for Practices, Clinics, and Hospitals of every size. As the requirements for Medical Records Management continue to change, practices need to stay updated on the latest data security practices and be in full compliance with the latest Records Retention Requirements. The MacKeeper Security Research Center did not download the entire user database, but only took screenshots as proof of the data leak and immediately notified Carebox and HealthELT to ensure the data was secured.</p>

<p>MacKeeper Security Research Center has discovered an unsecure public database that belongs to ABCya.com.</p>

<p>One of the biggest rules of data storage is to protect payment details of customers and taking every step possible to prevent unauthorized people to access stored cardholder data many companies use 3rd party merchant accounts to avoid processing payments.</p>

<p>If you represent a school or are a student, we invite you to apply for free <a href=""https://mackeeper.com/educational-licenses"">MacKeeper&trade; licenses for computer lab at your university, college, or school</a>.</p>

<p>ABCya claims to be the leader in free educational kids computer games and activities for elementary students to learn on the web and has an estimated monthly 4 million visitors per month. The site offers a wide range of games and tools to help children learn with educational games and tools. They claim &ldquo;Millions of kids, parents, and teachers visit ABCya.com each month, playing over 1 billion games last year&rdquo;. ABCya offers monthly subscriptions ranging from $6.99 to $29.99 and had the credit card data stored on a misconfigured database that was publically available.</p>

<ul>
	<li>credentials and info of 11k+ archived customers (incl. IPs, emails, names, temporary access code, hashed and salted passwords)</li>

</ul>

<p>The MacKeeper Security Research Team sent notifications on May 19th and received no response but noticed that databases are now secured and not publically available.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With each and every data breach it becomes clear that companies who store customer data must take every precaution to protect that data. Companies who store and collect credit card data have an additional responsibility and nearly every credit card provider discourages businesses from storing credit card data.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">One folder in the database seems to have a massive number of files that were publically accessible to anyone looking for them. The folder was titled &quot;NewStudentsApplicationReportForFinanceV1&quot; appears to have over 600K+ records for international students and includes personal information including names, emails, passwords, phones, account details, relatives info, passport details (all in plain text). Plus there was even correspondence records between the Cambridge Institute of International Education team members, and housing reports and working links to the pdf&#39;s and payment confirmations.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">In addition, there was an additional collection of records that included the detailed information of 12,000+ hosting houses, including the information on a household, family member details (such as medical conditions, if any, religious beliefs, even frequency of attending religious activities), occupation details, incl. emails and phones, birthdates, and other extremely sensitive data on the personal privacy of the host families. The database contained a treasure trove of sensitive data could have been used for a wide range of illicit activities and in addition to the possible illegal or criminal uses of this data, it is extremely embarrassing to see documentation of housing reports and detailed descriptions about students&rsquo; conflicts, medical conditions, personal problems, living conditions, and much more. &nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Interestingly, the MacKeeper Security Researcher who discovered the data leak when browsing in Shodan took notice that the database was named after a planet from Star Wars. The database was named &ldquo;Coruscant&rdquo; - &nbsp;a planet in the Star Wars universe (Imperial Center during the reign of the Galactic Empire).</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">The Cambridge Institute of International Education is yet another example of the importance of protecting sensitive data in the educational field. Since 2014 the number of students&rsquo; who have had their data compromised online has continued to grow and with over a half of a million accounts left unprotected, it shows the full scale of just how big the number of students Cambridge left vulnerable vs other recent leaks.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Vidigami is a photo management solution designed for schools and according to their website &ldquo;More than 100 leading independent schools in North America have chosen Vidigami as their photo management solution for school memories&rdquo;.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">On July 12th the MacKeeper Security Research Center identified an unsecure database that was publicly available and accessible without any form authorization. The database contained details on 118 thousand accounts and profiles, including login details (such as email) and hashed passwords, plus links to the images and archives.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">The discovery was made using Shodan public search as part of weekly external security monitoring routine.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">The MacKeeper Security Research Team was in contact with Sean Cunningham, who is a full-stack developer in Vidigami. He later confirmed that this MongoDB server was part of their testing environment and is not the live data of the service.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Whether or not is was &quot;testing environment&quot; you can judge by looking into redacted snapshots taken from the staging server. It still contained a trove of customer data such as login email, usernames, hashed passwords, images and archives.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Upon further communications Sean admitted that they indeed had technical issues that included a faulty configuration of the &quot;Fail2Ban&quot; service on their machines. Fail2Ban must be additionally configured to work alongside the firewall, the UFW was temporarily turned off for work to commence on the server. It was following this configuration of the fail2ban service that their UFW had encountered an error (based on a misunderstanding of the proper way to integrate the two services), and therefore causing the failed startup of the UFW.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">According to Vidigami, no data was affected but they are going to notify the users anyway. The MacKeeper Security Research Team has confirmed that the data is now secured and is not publically accessible. Vidigami was open and transparent on the notification of the data leak and acted fast to respond and secure the database.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">The MacKeeper Security Research Center has identified a data leak that publically exposed several thousand credentials and sensitive info for employees and staff members, including emails, names and plain passwords for admin panels of CEHTP web portals.&nbsp; The misconfigured database was publicly available without any password protection and contained&nbsp; the account information of 5,325 employees.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">California Department of Public Health started California Environmental Health Tracking Program to improve public health with better information. The MacKeeper Security Research Center contacted them the same day of the discovery to help secure any sensitive data before any further damage was done or any additional unwanted access. No response was given, but next day the database was secured and no longer publically accessible.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">&ldquo;Although no medical records were available there is a wide range of possibilities that criminals could use to exploit California Department of Public Health employee data once they have it.&rdquo; - MacKeeper Security Researcher.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">The real danger is that hackers or other bad actors could use the same passwords to try and gain access to sensitive data or commit fraud. In 2015 Harris Interactive and <em>Password</em> Boss estimated that 59% US customers also reuse the same passwords for multiple sites and accounts.

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Thinking about taking a trip to a far away exotic location? You might just have your payment data stored unsecurely and available for anyone with internet access. As payment processors continue to enhance their security measures and encryption methods the real problem is businesses that collect data and then store it in an unsecure way.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><strong>[This post has been updated to include statements on behalf of&nbsp;Silverland Hotels &amp; Spas&rsquo; IT team - <em>in italic</em>]</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">The MacKeeper Security Research Center has discovered an open database belonging to the Silverland Hotel in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam with thousands of unencrypted credit cards.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">The cardholder accounts include the payment information of Australian, US, UK citizens and a range of international guests who have stayed at the hotel.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Imagine you have saved and planned for your perfect holiday trip to Vietnam&rsquo;s capital, you booked your luxury hotel and of course you wouldn&#39;t expect your card details and personal info available online. Along with the payment information, database contained also login details, IP and special requests of the guests. The total number of entries reached 6377 items (i.e. credit cards details).</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">This open database was publically available and required no password to access. The exposed database and the website were hosted on the same IP address.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">The first notification was sent to the hotel email address immediately after we have identified the exposure during our weekly security scan on August 12th.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">[<em>The first email eventually discovered by Silverland, after being contacted by a customer late in the evening of August 29, in the hotel&rsquo;s junk mail folder was dated August 17 and contained the&nbsp;August 12&nbsp;email, which email did not include any address where it was purportedly sent</em>].</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">[<em>On August 30, 2016, MacKeeper engaged in a live chat with Silverland discussing the data leak.&nbsp; That very same day, August 30, Silverlands&rsquo; IT team contacted Hostgator about the problem and port 27017 was immediately closed with password protection.&nbsp; On September 6, 2016, Silverland completed the vulnerability assessment verifying that Silverland&rsquo;s web server was secure.&nbsp; Silverland&rsquo;s customers that may have been effected were notified of the data leak by email on September 7, 2016]</em></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">The <a href=""https://mackeepersecurity.com"">Security Research Center</a> sent multiple emails, used the live chat feature on the website and spoke with the assistant of the hotel owner using the private phone number found on the domain registry. Customers exposed as they continued to add additional credit card numbers to the database. &nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">It is unclear if the data was accessed by anyone else.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">[UPDATE]</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">The Silverland Hotels &amp; Spas&rsquo; IT team has secured the port in question with password protection, the web server has been secured, the customers that may have been effected have been notified, and Silverland Hotels &amp; Spas is working with the banking institutions to ensure that any potential problems are covered.&nbsp; Additionally, Silverland Hotels &amp; Spas has retained U.S. (Colorado) attorney Ira J. Bornstein to assist them in handling this matter.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">The Database contained and estimated 180 thousand log records and Personally Identifiable Information for 5500 customers unsecured, unencrypted and leaked online.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><strong>[UPDATE]: This post has been updated to include statements on behalf of EasySupport.com</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">[UPD:&nbsp;<em>Easysupport.com did respond&nbsp;to our primary email by sending an acknowledgment email on the same day we contacted them.&nbsp;However, response was not visible in our email system.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><em>The 180k entries are related to logs and should not be considered as being the number of customers we have. <strong>According to Easysupport.com the actual number of exposed customers is 5,500</strong>. Easysupport.com is planning an email to go out to notify all of them about server vulnerability. They are also setting up a dedicated line for customers to speak to the quality assurance team].</em></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">On Friday, Sept 16th the MacKeeper Cyber Security Research Center discovered a breach in a mongoDB database that apparently belonged to Canadian Based easysupport.com. According to their site, the company offers computer tech support and seems like one of their databases was misconfigured and was publically open for everyone to see.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">The publically accessible database named &ldquo;easysupport_live&rdquo; contained folders &quot;service_logs_merchant&quot; and included several hundred thousand records (see screenshot attached). Most of the records (not all, thankfully, but many) included IP / billing addresses / names / credit card information, with CVV, credit card number, expiration month/year etc. - in PLAIN text - for US and international customers. There was no method of encryption used and anyone could have downloaded the personal information and credit card data directly from easysupport.com&rsquo;s database. MacKeeper&rsquo;s Security Team reached out to easysupport.com by email and phone as soon as leak was discovered, but never recieved a response from the company. The database, however, was secured and no longer publically visible 5 hours after notification.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">According to the server data the database uptime was 1.13 days, while the IP itself was first indexed for public search on Sept 12th. It is still unknown how many people accessed it before the door was closed and it was secured. Consequences could have been even worse if server remained misconfigured for an extended period of time.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Storing credit card data in plain text and leaking that information online is in direct violation of Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC). The agency was created by American express, Discover, MasterCard, Visa, and JCB requires a minimum standard of security protection to be implemented by all merchants and service providers that handle sensitive credit card data. The payment brands themselves enforce the PCI DSS standard for merchants and service providers, regardless of size. If your company stores, processes, or transmits any of the information recorded on a credit or debit card then you must abide by the PCI DSS or face significant fines, card replacement costs, costly forensic audits, and more. As a Canadian based company they would be regulated by the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada that also requires minimum security standards on payment data and transactions.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Cyber security and protecting customer data is more important than ever and it seems like every day there is a new hack or data leak affecting consumers around the world. With such a strong focus on security it is clear that every company must have a basic system in place to safely secure, transmit, or store sensitive customer data. A &ldquo;hack&rdquo; is very different from a &ldquo;leak&rdquo; in the terms that in a &ldquo;hack&rdquo; outside actors gain access to the server or sensitive information. Where the &ldquo;leak&rdquo; is usually an internal issue, failure to properly secure or manage the database and the sensitive data stored there.<br />
There have been some massive data hacks in the last few years such as eBay:145 million records, Target: 70 million, and Adobe: 150 million breached records. However, this was potentially one of the largest leaks (not hacks!) of credit card data we have seen in 2016 with an estimated 180 thousand records leaked.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">[UPD: <em>According to Easysupport.com, database was exposed to public due to the migration of CRM system to a new server and was vulnerable for roughly 9 hours</em>]</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Most people believe that voting is a fundamental right of any democracy. In the United States an anonymous vote is considered your &ldquo;right&rdquo; and it is a cornerstone of the U.S. democratic process. This week researchers from the MacKeeper Security Research Center discovered an open and publically available database that contained detailed information on very voter in the state of Louisiana.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">The voter database was named &#39;lavoter&#39; was hosted on Google Cloud IP and contained 2,919,651 records for the entire state of Louisiana.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Information included the following categories (among other): Names, Full Address (incl. mail address), Sex, Race, Political Party Code, Voter Status, Registration Date, Registration Number, Personal Phone No., Last Voted data and Voting History data.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Exactly as specified at Louisiana&rsquo;s Secretary of State website: http://www.sos.la.gov/electionsandvoting/publisheddocuments/recordformatsheet.pdf</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Another database hosted on the same ip was named &lsquo;ladps&rsquo; and contained 6,978,508 records. We can only guess that it attributes to &lsquo;Department of Public Safety&rdquo;, since the following categories were presented in database:&nbsp; Full Name, Residence Address, Race, Sex, DOB, Height, Weight, Residence Parish code, Driving License Number, SSN code (but not the SSN itself), and issue number.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">That database also contained information on deceased people. The total count of records in that one leads us to believe that it corresponds to the demographics of Louisiana.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">When the MacKeeper Security Research Center was searching for the legal requirements for protecting voter data in the state of Louisiana we were shocked to discover that all voter data is for sale to basically anyone willing to pay for it. You do not even need to prove that you will use it for political purposes, research or any related election purpose. Louisiana&rsquo;s system gives you the option of choosing past or present voters and you separate by various demographics (gender, race etc.), specify the party of your choice. The price for buying voter data comes out at $0.01 per name on the list.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">http://www.sos.la.gov/ElectionsAndVoting/BecomeACandidate/PurchaseVoterLists/Pages/default.aspx&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">The current US election has shown us more than any other just how much technology has become a part of the process. The negative side of that is there is no common standard of security and data protection of election and voter data. The election rules and voter data varies from state to state and voter data may not even be considered private depending on where you live. The FBI has recently investigated the possibility of Russian hackers trying to influence the US election and in Dec 2015 MacKeeper&rsquo;s Chris Vickery identified 191 million voter records that were exposed because of a misconfiguration in a CouchDB installation. In July 2016 WikiLeaks released 19,252 emails and 8,034 attachments from the top of the US Democratic National Committee and many experts expect more information will be released before the election. The real question is why are Americans so worried about Russian hackers and protecting voter&rsquo;s personal data when some states will just sell it?&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Voter data and election should be considered &quot;critical infrastructure&quot; and not sold off to the highest bidder or wholesale prices. Citizens should at a minimum have the right to &ldquo;Opt Out&rdquo; of having their data sold if they live in a state that sells voter information.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">It is unclear if the database discovered by the MacKeeper Security Research Center belonged to the State of Louisiana, a political organization, or who? The files include driver&rsquo;s license numbers so this would make us assume that only the state would have that sensitive information and those would be likely be removed from any sold lists. Regardless of who is responsible for the database it was publically available and exposing the data of 2.9 million voters.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">The database has since been secured. It is unknown, how many people got access to it and who was the owner.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">On Sept 28th Mackeeper Security Research Center experts identified another unprotected MongoDB instance that was leaking data.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Database appeared to be part of C&amp;Z Tech Limited, a New Zealand registered company that operates the websites<a href=""http://haveafling.mobi""> haveafling.mobi</a>,<a href=""http://haveafling.co.nz""> haveafling.co.nz</a>,<a href=""http://haveanaffair.co.nz""> haveanaffair.co.nz</a>,<a href=""http://haveanaffair.mobi""> haveanaffair.mobi</a>,<a href=""http://hookupdating.mobi""> hookupdating.mobi</a> and the mobile application &quot;Hook Up Dating&quot;. As the names clearly indicate they are all dating sites that target men and women &quot;who are either attached/married seeking something fun on the side, or single seeking something casual&quot;.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">The case of a &ldquo;cheating&rdquo; website brings back memories of the strange case of Ashley Madison. According to Forbes &ldquo;Worldwide, the site has had 31 million total users over its lifetime, 6.8 million of whom logged in over the previous 90 days as of late November&rdquo;. Unlike the Ashley Madison data that was actually hacked, this database was left open, unsecured and accessible to anyone. The fallout from the Ashley Madison hack destroyed marriages, families, and was even suspected in several suicides. Knowing the real danger of this data being leaked there is an added need for data protection and security. &nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">The exposed database contained more than 1.5 million users&rsquo; data, including usernames and passwords in plain text among the others (height, weight, DOB, gender, gay body type, race, IP, country etc) was left unattended for almost a day before it was secured.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Shortly after we sent notification to the company support we received the following message from &quot;Edward&quot; from HAF team.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><em>&ldquo;Thanks for letting us know, the MongoDB database was only live for a few hours as we were testing migrating data from SQL to MongoDB, so most of them were just dummy data with randomly generated emails and passwords, and not our live database, we shut down the database about an hour ago, and there&#39;re no data breach, only you guys had detected it. </em></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><em>Once again thanks for letting us know and we will make sure to secure it before making it live again.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">This type of answer is rather usual to claim that this is testing environment with so many files and accounts. We highly doubt this was &ldquo;testing&rdquo; data based on the type of files exposed and the massive number of accounts. Yes, our security research team still has a copy of the data for verification purposes.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">The database is now secured but it raises a different question. How long should sensitive data be exposed and unsecured before it is called a data leak?</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">In line with what some US courts have said, a breach occurs the very moment that data is put in a publicly accessible place. So if it was available to the public for even one second, then it&#39;s a breach.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Leaked data is leaked data and it puts users at risk. If our security research team was able to discover and obtain this information, anyone else could have also. If a &ldquo;bad actor&rdquo; or criminal was to get this information they could try and blackmail individual users with threats to expose their infidelity and other forms of extortion. &nbsp;</p>

Sadly, this election has shown us time and time again just how insecure and unprotected the entire process truly is. It seems to be getting worse, from hacked emails showing the DNC may have tilted the primary elections to multiple misconfigured databases containing millions of voters&rsquo; data and voting history. The flow of data this US election is almost overwhelming and just when one news story breaks another one appears before the first one runs the full news cycle.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">This week the MacKeeper Security Research Center discovered a publically available database of voter records totalling more than 350K. The records are from multiple states and split among MT / NJ / CA / VA.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><em><strong>California voter_file = 60,744 records</strong></em></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><em><strong>MT voter_file = 50,000 records</strong></em></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><em><strong>NJ voter_file = 72,114 records</strong></em></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><em><strong>VA voter_file = 62,574 records (with party ID, WardCode, VANID)</strong></em></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><em><strong>VA voter_file = 61,995 records</strong></em></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><em><strong>VA voter_file = 46,625 records</strong></em></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify""><strong>354,052 records in total!</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">The personal information includes names, home address, phone number, gender, date of birth, state voter ID, race, marital status, unique voter ID, date of voter registration, phone number, political affiliation and whether or not they voted in primary elections and more.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Some states restrict how the data may be used and sets restrictions for commercial or charity. Most states require that voter data be used only for political and election related activities, but what if the records are leaked publically and are available to anyone online?</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">The challenge going forward will be how to secure voter records that are likely already compromised or in some cases for sale by the state election commissions. In September 2015 <a href=""https://mackeepersecurity.com/post/2-9-million-louisiana-voters-data-leaked"">MacKeeper discovered 2.9 million voter records</a> from the state of Louisiana and discovered a disturbing reality that the state was selling voter records. Louisiana&rsquo;s system gives you the option of choosing past or present voters and you separate by various demographics (gender, race etc.), specify the party of your choice. The price for buying voter data comes out at $0.01 per name on the list. How or will states and private groups protect voter data or will voter data just become public record similar to court records?</p>

The massive amount of data was improperly stored in a misconfigured database and publically available online. Nearly all of the records stored and collected appear to be French citizens and the data includes including names, emails, DOBs, delivery addresses, phones and billing information.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">The MacKeeper Security Research Center has reached out to store to secure the data, but no answer has been received yet and database is still leaking data.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">No hack or password was required to access the customer data.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">The French Data Protection Act (DPA) applies to any person that is in charge of collecting, processing or storing personal data and it appears that store may be in violation by not securing their customers&rsquo; data. According to the DPA there is also a civil liability for collecting sensitive information and data subjects have a right to compensation if they suffer damage. The French Data Protection Act has a very broad conception of personal data. For example, a telephone number is considered to be personal data. In this recent find there is much more identifying data that would qualify as personal under the law.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">Below is an example of how the records look. More than 13 million records stored as &quot;Cookies&quot; and include the following info (redacted):</p>

Another important aspect is understanding the legal requirements for data storage and collection methods. Many small business owners overlook the importance of data security and just create their store and focus on selling products, but they are often legally required to secure the customer information they collect.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">The MacKeeper Security Research Center recommends that any company collecting data test their database and make sure that they are using the best practices and they have taken every possible step to secure their data. A simple security audit can save you future legal problems or the damage to your customers and business reputation. &nbsp;</p>

If you have you likely drove away from the dealership thinking about gas mileage and crash safety in your new car. However, in the digital age there is one more thing you should consider and that is: did the dealership leak my personal data and credit information online?</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">However, in the digital age there is one more thing you should consider and that is: did the dealership leak my personal data and credit information online? With the latest discovery of nearly a million records leaked online both automotive dealership employees and customers alike have had their private data left vulnerable to criminals. We must now face the reality that no matter what industry you work in or what products you buy there is a strong chance that your sensitive personal data could be leaked online if it is not secured properly. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">It appears that the database containing the information belongs to <a href=""http://dealerbuilt.com"">dealerbuilt.com</a>, a dealer management and payroll system. On their website they claim that &ldquo;DealerBuilt&rsquo;s Payroll Application offers a comprehensive solution to manage your payroll needs&rdquo;. They also offer customizable reporting tools that help dealerships historically document and review payroll and other vital employee information. Despite managing the private and sensitive data of over a million customers and salespeople there is no mention of how DealerBuilt handles security or data protection of all of these records.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">Here is the public report still visible at Shodan: <a href=""https://www.shodan.io/host/199.102.214.20#873"" target=""_blank"">https://www.shodan.io/host/199.102.214.20#873</a></p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">This discovery immediately attracted our attention, since this particular instance featured 128 folders named after clients. All of them were password-protected, except one, the most vulnerable were - &ldquo;DealerBuilt&rdquo;, with &ldquo;Clients&rsquo; backup&rdquo;. It appeared that this folder contained all their clients&rsquo; CRM SQL database backups. When restored and mounted, these databases were an infinite source of private data.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">Upon further analysis of the content we came to the conclusion that the data formatted across the tables are almost exactly the same because the company hosting them (DealerBuilt) is giving all of their car dealership customers the same CRM software.<br />

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">Just to give you an example: there were several folders containing the private and personal information of over a thousands customers and employees. These files include names like &ldquo;faemployee&quot; and &quot;lycustomer&quot;. In just one document called &quot;lycustomer&quot; there are 27,703 people. Some of the files have social security numbers and even spouse social security numbers. The &ldquo;faemployee&rdquo; table contained from 60 to 300 rows of information. Multiplied by 128, you can guess or estimate the total number of individuals who have had their personal data exposed.<br />

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">When employment data is leaked that contains social security numbers it makes it a higher risk for criminals to engage in identity theft, filing false tax returns or other forms of fraud. This same risk likely applies to the many thousands of customers who have purchased vehicles or possibility even applied for financing with every dealership who uses the DealerBuilt platform. This massive leak is just another painful lesson of what happens when private and sensitive data is stored without encryption or modern data security practices. The <a href=""http://dealerbuilt.com"">dealerbuilt.com</a> database is now secured and it is unclear how many other people may have accessed the data or what steps DealerBuilt will take to notify the millions of affected customers and salespeople.</p>

A child&rsquo;s data is extremely vulnerable because they often have no choice in who stores or collects their data. As online technology and digital records become the modern standard it is more important than ever to protect the personal data and medical records of children. Having your data leaked as a child could follow you around for the rest of your life and this is why data protection must be taken serious.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">The MacKeeper Security Research Center found that Louisiana School for the Visually Impaired was running a leaky instance of the Rsync protocol. This protocol is widely used for remote synchronization between computers and in most cases it is protected from external access. But there are still many &ldquo;live&rdquo; examples when Rsync is left without any password authentication. &nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">Due to that particular breach we were able to access a virtual drive of institution which contained a lot of internal and sensitive information. The data included highly sensitive information such as the children&#39;s State ID Number, birth dates, full names, photos, accommodation details, medical impairment comments etc. And yes, this information was available online without any password and login, so basically anyone with an Internet connection could have download it.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">Among other data there was a file that contained a total of 3,647 records of 200 children from the Louisiana School for the Visually Impaired, a K-12 state-operated school located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, United States. The school has both blind and other visually impaired students.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">In September 2016 The MacKeeper Security Research Center discovered a database of <a href=""https://mackeeper.com/blog/post/277-louisiana-voters-data-leaked"">2.9 million voters from Louisiana</a>. Upon notifying the state about the data breach we worked with Mr. Dustin Glover the Chief Information Security Officer from the Office of Technology Services for the State of Louisiana who was able to help us secure the database within a matter of hours. We would like thank Mr. Glover once again for his fast and professional assistance in identifying who is responsible for managing this database and ensuring that the children&rsquo;s data was urgently secured.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">This kind of data has been recently discovered by MacKeeper researchers during the regular security scan. No username or password was required to access it as if it was a public database.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">Another misconfigured MongoDB instance was part of the&nbsp;lending company, <a href=""https://anchorloans.com/"">Anchor Loans</a>, a big player in the lending sector for real estate investments that has originated more than 13 000 loans totaling over $3.7 billion. The company operates as a mortgage pool, investing directly in trust deeds and earning income from the interest paid by borrowers.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">The database contained&nbsp;sensitive information such as SSNs, passwords, spouse information (incl. SSN), e-mail addresses, driver&rsquo;s license numbers, financial details including salary and even bank statement amount.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">Moreover, there were records of transaction details and communication logs with investors.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">Plus logins and passwords required for clients to authorize on Anchor Loans web resources and indirect links to the scanned copies of contracts.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">Once our experts have come across this information, we&rsquo;ve contacted company representative to report about the data breach and help get it secured. Anchor Loan was quick in getting back to us and currently internal investigation in under way. Database had been taken offline since then.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">According to Anchor Loan: &quot;<em>Based on what we now know, however, we believe that much of the information was related to real estate data and real estate transactions, some of which is publicly available, and the great majority of which is not sensitive personal identifying information of our contacts.&nbsp; At this time, we have identified approximately 20,000 individuals whose data could have been exposed, had any of this data been illegally copied or accessed by any other third party.&nbsp; Again, we are continuing our investigation, and we will continue to refine these numbers</em>&quot;.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">Any industry that works with sensitive information such as banking and finance must take every possible step to secure their customer&rsquo;s data. State and Federal requires that not only is this information kept secure and private, but also that borrowers&rsquo; be notified of any breach. Some states even go as far as to require credit monitoring and repair for up to 3 years.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">As company indicates on the website: &ldquo;Rates and terms are dependent on your application. The more information you provide, the more options we can provide you with&rdquo;. Applicants are encouraged to leave more personal details and thus become an attractive target for attackers.<br />

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">According to Anchor Loans, &quot;<em>as soon as we have sufficient information to do so, we will take all necessary steps to ensure that the individuals who may have been impacted are appropriately informed, and to provide information and resources to any of our contacts who have questions about the security of their data or our response to this incident</em>&quot;.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">Needles to say that if such data falls into malicious hands both company&rsquo;s current clients and potential borrowers are at risk to have accounts misused by scammers. One of such cases was halted by Federal Trade Commission in Missouri. According to Jessica Rich, Director of the <a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2014/09/ftc-action-halts-payday-loan-scheme-bilked-tens-millions"">FTC&rsquo;s</a> Bureau of Consumer Protection, two scammers bought consumers&rsquo; personal information, made unauthorized payday loans, and then helped themselves to consumers&rsquo; bank accounts without their authorization.</p>

On Dec 1st the MacKeeper Security Research Center discovered Joan Jett&rsquo;s BlackHeart Records leaking hundreds of gigabytes of data online. BlackHeart Records is an Independent label founded by Joan Jett and Kenny Laguna and has a good reputation as an established label with a range of well known artists.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">The data breach is a massive treasure trove for fans and cyber criminals alike. There are unreleased tracks, never before seen pictures, even rejection letters from 1980 when Joan Jett was trying to get a record deal. There are also social security numbers of label employees and band members, internal memos and scanned checks of royalty payments and much more.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">From the entertaining obsessed fan emails to lawsuits and arrest records of the label manager, this database is a look inside of how the record label is operated and the communication between rock and roll royalty.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">Although there are no naked pictures or Hollywood style tabloid drama in the hundreds of gigabytes and countless thousands of files, there is a complete view of the many aspects of being a famous rockstar, operating a record label, and the meticulous documentation of every achievement, failure, or internal and external communications.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">With the social security numbers, banking information, scans of passports, and IDs it is easy to see that cyber criminals could have exploited this data for identify theft, fraud, or extortion. The data is now secured and it is not known how long that IP was publically available.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">One of the files that caught our attention was a folder named &ldquo;Lawsuits&rdquo;.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">Buddy Miles the legendary drummer and a member of Jimi Hendrix&#39;s Band of Gypsys (1969&ndash;1970).&nbsp; In 2003 Miles sued Jimi Hendrix&rsquo;s estate for invasion of privacy, breach of contract, unfair trade practice, and false advertising. The defendants also included Universal, EMI, Warner Bros., MCA. Miles claims he was a co-writer on many well known Hendrix hit songs, but the family denied this and claimed that Mr. Miles was a hired musician and was not entitled to any additional royalties or compensation. Buddy Miles died in 2008 and it is unclear what ever became of the lawsuit because the judge ordered a gag order and there is no public record of this case. The MacKeeper Security Research Team has seen the motions, court documents and assumes these are true and correct accounts of legal action.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">The data was completely exposed to the public internet with no username, password, or other authentication method in place. Anyone in the entire world with an internet connection could download the data. Generally, when dealing with software, the word &quot;vulnerable&quot; is used to describe a system that can be, or is, exploited in some fashion. In this situation, no exploit or deception was utilized in any way.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">The database is associated with the <a href=""http://sdno.com/"">Bump 2 Baby &amp; Beyond</a> company, which provides pregnancy ultrasounds and screening for patients.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">The unsecured Rsync protocol was indexed by Shodan service and was set to stream data without any password protection, allowing anyone with an internet connection and Rsync client to access hundreds of patient profiles.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">This is not a single rsync problem that was detected by MacKeeper. Based on the research, MacKeeper team has noticed that the remote synchronization protocol (rsync) is currently one of the biggest cybersecurity threats. Cloning of critical servers by using unprotected RSYNC makes the data, files and folders vulnerable to ransomware, injections, or executable files. In many cases the folders are writable and can even be deleted remotely.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">The MacKeeper team together with Databreaches.net made several attempts to alert the company about the leaky database but, unfortunately, had no luck. Apparently now the problem is solved and the database has already been secured, although MacKeeper and Databreaches.net got no response.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">Bump 2 Baby &amp; Beyond is a diagnostic firm that is based in LA and owned by the technologist Michael Rodriguez. The company provides ultrasound services in doctors&rsquo; offices for pregnant patients and for patients who require screening for health problems. &nbsp;Since 2012, the database of Bump 2 Baby &amp; Beyond contains about 1,000 patients&rsquo; files.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">This data includes patients&rsquo; forms with names, dates of birth, address, email address, telephone numbers, due dates, physician&rsquo;s names, and methods of payment. The database also contains the permissions for using of the woman&rsquo;s name and ultrasound image on the company website for advertising or promotional purposes.<br />
The database contains other files, such as medical reports, the detection of abnormalities, detections of problems with carotid arteries, aortic issues, etc, and in rare cases even more sensitive information, such as fetal demise.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">Furthermore, the data contains internal information about the business and Rodriguez&rsquo;s personal details. The MacKeeper team has discovered internal financial documentation, files on a child with special needs, and files containing tax returns with children&#39;s names and Social Security numbers.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">Fortunately, the database doesn&#39;t contain any sensitive financial information, such as credit card information or patient SSN in the exposed files. &nbsp;But in some cases, credit card numbers were partially exposed.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">As you may know, medical records are protected in the US under Federal and State law. Hospitals, Doctors and Insurers can face big fines and penalties when medical records are leaked online. On Dec 30th, 2016 the MacKeeper Security Research Center discovered a misconfigured Mongo database that contained hundreds of thousands of what appeared to be patient records and other sensitive information.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">The IP was hosted on Google Cloud and results for domain names hosted on that address (Reverse IP) identified Emory Brain Health Center. On Jan 3rd 2017 when the research team went back to review the data it was identified that the database had been a victim of the Harak1r1 the 0.2 Bitcoin Ransomware. This non traditional ransom method actually takes and removes the victims&rsquo; data and holds it until the ransom is paid. The data is wiped out completely from the database and is not simply encrypted like most common types of ransomware attacks. See details here:</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">Militarysleep.org is a paitent portal where users can create their accounts, discuss treatment ooptions, and ask questions about their sleep disorders. Researchers from the MacKeeper Security Research Center have discovered a publically accessible Mongo database that contains the private medical data of thousands of military veterans who suffer from sleep disorders.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">The database contained a total of 2+ Gigs database containing more than 1,300 messages (sensitive communications between patients and doctors) and personal data of more than 1,200 users, including their names, emails, personal cell numbers, unencrypted passwords and military history/ service rank. The most damaging information discovered are the stored notes and chat logs where patients ask questions about sensitive medical issues they are experiencing and believing the communication is confidential. Many of the email address are @us.army.mil and we can assume treat both active and former millitary service members.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify""><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/e901f140df304439db821022ce09326a586ea746d2de2.png"" style=""height:391px; width:700px"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">Medical privacy is extremely important for both citizens and military veterans and if details are leaked about their diagnoses and treatment, it could affect their current employment, future employment, security clearances or other areas of their lives. Even worse the fear that employers could discriminate against an applicant or employee based on their leaked medical records or likelihood of illness. This is why protecting medical records is so important and every step for cyber security must be taken. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">The site is registered to Maryland based Dr. Emerson Wickwire PhD and according to his personal website &ldquo;My research interests focus on biobehavioral sleep processes including sleep as therapy for the body and brain, the most common sleep disorders, sleep in special populations, and dissemination of best practices.&rdquo;</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Luckily, this database did not fall victim of the Harak1r1 the 0.2 Bitcoin Ransomware - a malicious actor who targets unprotected MongoDB all around the world.

<p style=""text-align:justify"">The Militarysleep.org database was discovered just one day after thousands of similarly misconfigured Mongo databases were infected and had all of the data removed and held ransom for 0.2 Bitcoin to recover their files. This unfortunate data leak may have just saved their data from being deleted by the Harak1r1 Bitcoin Ransomware. Earlier this week the MacKeeper Research Center discovered a database connected to Emory Healthcare where an estimated 200k medical records had been deleted and only a request for the ransom remained in the database.

The backup device contained the detailed medical history of thousands of patients that were publically accessible with no password protection or encryption methods. Medical records are among the most private and sensitive data and can pose a serious risk for patients and doctors alike. These records could potentially be used to file false claims, extort patients, or even employer bias against sick patients who may miss work because of their illness or medical history. This is why securing and protecting medical data should always be a top priority.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">The files contained before and after pictures of breast augmentation, implants, and reduction. SpaSurgica also offers labial reduction, liposuction, and a wide range of plastic surgery options that many customers would want private. The pictures, descriptions, and medical history of each patient gives an intimate look at what type of data was leaked. These are not just home addresses and medical records, these are intimate pictures of patient&#39;s bodies. There was also access to unencrypted text files containing usernames and passwords for accounts, printers, and other password protected protected logins.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">We are grateful to Dissent from databreaches.net who participated in this investigation and helped to notify Dr. Mohamed Elmaraghy&rsquo;s office of the leak. Access has since been closed and is no longer publically available. We never heard back from SpaSurgica, although several notification emails were sent immedidately after discovery.</p>

PHIPA also provides a legal obligation on physicians to maintain and comply with information practices that keep their patients&rsquo; personal health information protected against theft, loss or unauthorized use or disclosure. If personal health information is stolen, lost or accessed by unauthorized individuals. &nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">The Law Requires Containment and Notification:</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">If faced with a privacy breach, there are two priorities that must be addressed immediately:</p>

The data appears to come from a franchise branch located in California. The company prints everything from sensitive legal documents, medical records, to signs and more. All of the files were publically available with no password protection. The leak also contained an email backup of all communications, print files, and even customer payment details.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">The majority of 400+ GB server is dedicated to design files and images relating to the printing business. The most sensitive information is contained within the &ldquo;Outlook archives&rdquo; and &ldquo;Scans&rdquo; folders.

There is an archive of correspondence where company&#39;s clients ask managers to make copies of the attached documents.

Potentially MacKeeper Security Research Center&rsquo;s Biggest Discovery to Date.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">Researchers from the MacKeeper Security Research Center have made one of the biggest discoveries to date with several hundred thousand files publically available. The files belong to a controversial Florida based marketing company VICI Marketing LLC and include thousands of audio recordings where customers give their names, addresses, phone number, credit card numbers, CV numbers and more. In 2009 VICI Marketing LLC agreed to pay $350,000 to settle a complaint by the Florida Attorney General&#39;s Office that the firm obtained stolen consumer information and did not take proper steps to ensure data was acquired legitimately. Researchers have confirmed that despite the fine and penalties they have still not secured customer or company data and there is a date range of recordings going back several years. Under the agreement: If the terms of the injunction are violated, Vici could be subject to a $1 million civil penalty.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">There is enough information in each call to provide cyber criminals with all they need to steal the credit card information or commit a wide range of crimes. Some of the recordings do not warn customers that the calls are being recorded or stored. Eleven states require the consent of every party to a phone call or conversation in order to make the recording lawful. These &quot;two-party consent&quot; laws have been adopted in California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Washington.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">Improper data storage or misconfigured databases can happen to companies big and small, but for a company who has already paid a hefty price and has been the subject of regulatory violations it seems like they would take cyber security more seriously. In the 2009 case where they were accused of obtaining stolen consumer information VICI&#39;s lawyer, Robby Birnbaum claimed &quot;We don&#39;t have proof of that&quot;. Under the terms of the 2009 settlement Vici is permanently prohibited from acquiring or using data without due diligence, using data of unlawful or questionable origin, accessing and using data for consumer telemarketing without background due diligence, and unlawful telemarketing. The files that The MacKeeper Security Researchers have discovered contains hundreds of thousands of records and could take several weeks to go through them all and It is unclear if the sensitive data is being sold or acquired by 3rd parties. Researchers have downloaded a 28 GB copy of the backup for verification purposes and will securely delete the publically available documents once the case is closed. MacKeeper works closely with law enforcement and US Homeland Security in cases where data becomes part of a criminal or civil investigation. There is no suspected wrongdoing at this time other than leaking as many as 17,649 audio recordings with credit card numbers and private customer files. &nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">There is also 375,368 audio recordings that can be qualified as &quot;cold calls&quot;, with some of those containing personal information as well.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify""><img alt="""" src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/cf-mackeeper/img/blog/upload/492eb9dd3c8e8ba8c30b61752ae11ba0588b0e3888f27.png"" style=""height:538px; width:700px"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">The internet if full of complaints of how VICI Marketing LLC operates or claims and allegations from former employees. When searching for customer reviews and employee comments we discovered a <a href=""http://thenudetruth.com/2013/08/11/buyer-beaware-part-ii-a-free-trial-combo-skin-dmrejuva-glow-that-may-cost-you-at-least-92-61/#comment-217https://www.google.com.ua/search?num=100&amp;safe=off&amp;site=&amp;source=hp&amp;q=states+that+do+not+allow+phone+recording&amp;oq=states+that+do+not+allow+phone+re&amp;gs_l=hp.3.0.0i22i30k1l5.375.7213.0.8725.28.17.1.9.10.0.139.1578.13j4.17.0....0...1c.1.64.hp..1.27.1625...0j0i10k1.Ad1uMiTgG6M"">blog</a> post describing how VICI would give customers a promotional gift if they only pay for the shipping. They offered Skin DM/RejuvaGlow cream that was supposed to cost $3.95 and ended up costing $92.61 after everything was over. A former employee by the name of Justin Tyme says:</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">&ldquo;For everyone&#39;s knowledge the name of the actual company ripping you off is VICI Marketing LLC, it is a company based out of Largo FL. I worked here for a period of time not knowing what kind of scams they were pulling on people, but it didn&#39;t take me long to realize what was REALLY going on, It would take ages to explain in detail the elaborate scam these people have going on, but what I can tell you is that they advertise these products (which usually can be purchased in drug stores for $20 or less) in hopes that the consumer will either not read the terms and conditions, or simply forget to call in and cancel&hellip;and believe me IT HAPPENS OFTEN. By the time the consumer realizes what has happen they have already been bill in excess of $100 or more&hellip;.when the customer calls in for a refund, they make it sound like you can&#39;t get one by offering them to keep the products and only giving them partial refunds. Im sure there are some of you who returned the product to sender and refused shipments right? And when you call in to ask about your refund your told that you can&#39;t have one because you didn&#39;t send the product back properly and it wasn&#39;t processed back into the warehouse!!! The very same person telling you that can clearly see in your account that the product has been return successfully but they mark it &ldquo;no RMA&rdquo; so the company knows not to give your money back.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">2016 has been one of the most active years in cyber security history with massive email hacks, data leaks and cyber election meddling. MacKeeper takes a look back at the previous year and shares their top 10 discoveries.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">It has been a productive first year and we have helped secure the private data of literally hundreds of millions of people from around the world. Nearly all of the databases discovered by the MacKeeper Security Research Center contained some type of sensitive information that affected the privacy and data security of those individuals.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify"">The year in review gives us a chance to highlight significant discoveries like in 2015 when MacKeeper Researcher Chris Vickery discovered the voter database of the entire United States! The misconfigured database contained personal information of 154 million Americans including addresses, estimated income, ethnicity, phone numbers, political affiliation, and voting history. As we bring 2016 to a close, we hope that in 2017 companies and individuals take cyber security seriously.</p>

The first of which affects approximately 1.3 million students.,,"<p>Schoolzilla, a student data warehousing platform, made the all-too-common mistake of configuring their cloud storage (an Amazon S3 bucket) for public access. I discovered the bucket after noticing a few other unsecured buckets related to the Tableau data visualization platform. There was an exposed &ldquo;sz.tableau&rdquo; bucket, so I started looking for other &ldquo;sz&rdquo; iterations. That&rsquo;s when I came across &ldquo;sz-backups&rdquo;, which turned out to be a main repository for Schoolzilla&rsquo;s database backups.</p>

<p>I downloaded several of the production backups, the largest was titled &ldquo;Web_Data_FULL&rdquo; and weighed in at 12 gigs. After loading them into a local MSSQL instance I did some review and concluded that this was most likely real student data and did indeed come from Schoolzilla. The possibility of a false-flag operation is always in the back of my head (a scenario in which an unscrupulous company creates a false data breach which appears to originate from a competitor).</p>

<p>Schoolzilla was quick to respond when I submitted a data breach notification ticket. They secured the data and opened dialogue with me to learn the full extent of the issue. I applaud their incident response. This was the first situation of its kind for them and they reacted professionally. It must have been grueling for the CEO to phone each client and relay the unpleasant news, but they did it within only a few days of my report.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, Schoolzilla understood the problem and took responsibility. They did not try to shoot the messenger or claim that I had somehow &ldquo;hacked&rdquo; them. That&rsquo;s worth an extra-large gold star on the board for them.</p>

<p>Unlike most reports, I do not have any redacted screenshots to share for this one. The sheer volume of private student data, including scores and social security numbers for children, convinced me that it should be purged from my storage in an expedited fashion. I did however seek guidance from the US Department of Education before overwriting my copies just in case they wanted them preserved for any investigatory purposes. Unfortunately, the Department&rsquo;s voicemail box is currently full and I could not leave a message.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">While the exact nature of the leak is nothing new, a third-party IT vendor&rsquo;s unsecured rsync backup device, the amount of money involved is on the large side. The files indicate that AMP has over $50 million on the books and additionally include the private details of over 10,000 account applicants.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><img alt="""" src=""//static.mackeepersecurity.com/image/upload/tmp_99c99e4e7411b14c8ff6847ad3c032d1.png"" style=""height:478px; width:700px"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The portion I downloaded comes to about 70 gigs and represents 97,000 different files. It includes credit reports, passport scans, internal company emails, customer chat logs, and basically everything an identity thief would need in order to mount a serious campaign. I was surprised at the number of plaintext customer passwords discussed in the chat logs (by staff and customers alike).</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">It took a few days for me to make contact with a real person at AMP. This is not entirely AMP&rsquo;s fault though, as companies related to the stock market close down for the Good Friday holiday, which is then followed by a weekend.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><img alt="""" src=""//static.mackeepersecurity.com/image/upload/tmp_fb3478b9e9801c847e80d925efb8070d.png"" style=""height:439px; width:700px"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The head honcho over at AMP was surprised when I fully explained the situation to him over a phone call. He rightly wondered what AMP was paying its third-party IT company for. If a third party, which specializes in IT, can&rsquo;t catch this kind of leakage themselves, there is some serious improvement to be done.</p>

<p>AMP&rsquo;s CEO was relieved to hear that I wasn&rsquo;t trying to sell him anything or attempting any sort of blackmail or extortion, and I&rsquo;m thankful he understood that I merely discovered the unsecured data rather than causing it to become unsecured. That&rsquo;s a distinction many people fail to grasp, especially when their company is potentially in the hot seat.<br />
<br />
In closing, I would like to say a special &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to everyone that has read and passed along my reports of data insecurities over the past year and a half. I (Chris Vickery) am moving on to other ventures, but I wish the very best to everyone that will continue the great work we have been doing here at the MacKeeper Security Research Center.</p>

Small businesses are now one of the most targeted areas of cyber crime and the trend is on the rise. Researchers believe small business customer data is even more valuable because they are smaller and have less resources to identify or protect against a data breach or data leak.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">In November of 2016 Kromtech Security Researchers discovered a database that was associated with one of the biggest online pet retailer. We immediately notified site owners regarding the misconfigured database, but never received any response. We had hoped that someone would reply and secure the database, but for 6 months they never did. These are over 110,000 customer accounts and payment details. It is obvious that If this data were to fall into the wrong hands and be used for fraud, the folks may face more than just damage to their reputation, they could face fines and possible regulatory actions.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">In total Kromtech Security Researchers sent 3 email notifications and a followup phone call to alert them of how much customer data was publically available and to secure it as soon as possible. What good is identifying security vulnerabilities, notifying the affected company if the company refuses to take action to secure their own data or protect their own customers? The only way cyber security and data protection can move forward and change with the ever evolving threats is if companies and individuals take it serious and make the necessary changes to their data protection methods. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">Mishandling customer payment data is not just reckless, it can even have legal implications for companies or individuals who mishandle sensitive data. <a href=""https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_DSS_v3-2.pdf?agreement=true&amp;time=1479730302346"">According to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)</a>, retailers do face serious potential consequences for non-compliance with standard security protocols in their daily operations. In addition, sensitive authentication data such as CVC, CVV, and CVV2 must not be stored after authorization, even if encrypted. The PCI DSS standard was created to &ldquo;increase controls around cardholder data to reduce credit card fraud via its exposure.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">It is so important for any company big or small to take every possible step to secure their customer&#39;s&rsquo; private information, sensitive data, or payment details. As time has shown us, the threats will only continue to grow and based on recent data small businesses are more of a target than ever before. According to SecurityMagazine: &ldquo;Only 31 percent of small businesses take active measures to guard themselves against security breaches and an estimated 41 percent of small businesses are unaware of the risks&rdquo;.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify""><strong>What Exactly Was There?</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">The database contained a lot of company&rsquo;s attributions, such as emails, addresses, names, and other identifying details of their customers. Going deeper, we discovered that the Rsync protocol was set to stream data without any password protection. It means that anyone with an Internet connection and an Rsync client could have download the data belonging to more than 190,000 customers. This data included checkout information, shipping addresses, emails, names, phones, and credit card details such as 16-digit numbers, expiration date, cardholder names, etc. There was no CVV code listed &quot;as is&quot;, but some fields contained it, apparently by mistake.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify""><img alt="""" src=""//static.mackeepersecurity.com/image/upload/tmp_bd8988f004e244689c6e5bce35ba03ac.png"" style=""height:352px; width:672px"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">Pet store claims to be the specialty pet retailer offering services and solutions for the lifetime needs of pets.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">Apparently, the problem is in the way and how the website collects and stores personal data of its&rsquo; customers. A member of the research team made a test order and we realized that the website doesn&rsquo;t use any login and password for user data backups. The amount of information that the website asked us to provide during the checkout, would make any customer uneasy, but shocking for those of us in the security and data protection community.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">The total number of exposed credit and debit cards listed in the database is 110,429, and what is more disturbing, this list shows that site has been collecting the customer&#39;s card data since 2002. Some of the credit cards have already expired but those that were added between 2015 and 2016 are still active and in some cases the CVV numbers of the credit cards are also listed.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify""><img alt="""" src=""//static.mackeepersecurity.com/image/upload/tmp_b30480c7395630360326c69db7b1f2fd.png"" style=""height:336px; width:641px"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align:justify"">How stolen credit card data may be used? In 2014, when more than 600,000 individuals had their personal details stolen from the UK companies. The credit card details were sold for only &pound;1 (about $1.3 USD) per card on the dark web, and to date it is still unknown where exactly that data was taken from. That case remains the biggest leak of credit card details ever. Our recent investigation shows that money may be taken from the victim&#39;s credit card even without knowing a CVV code. Cardholder&#39;s claim that retailers such as Amazon may charge money from their credit cards without asking for Card Verification Value (CVV). The same happens in the hotels, which can charge or freeze the money on the credit card without knowing the CVV code.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><img alt="""" src=""//static.mackeepersecurity.com/image/upload/tmp_1fc04c1da0a261817140b2e2a44da460.png"" style=""height:492px; width:700px"" /></p>

<p>Upon further investigation we were able to identify what appeared to be customer purchase information (such as full names, address, zip,last 4 SSN digits), credit scores (FICO auto scores), year, makes, and models. Once it was clear this was automotive financing data we found the name of who we believed were associated with the exposed data. &nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The files allegedly belong to <a href=""https://www.alliancedirectlending.com/"">Alliance Direct Lending Corporation</a>, an automobile finance company in that refinances auto loans or uses a network of dealers to match with pre-qualified buyers.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The leaked data contained 124 files (each of them containing from 5 to 10 thousands records, which brings us to 550K - 1M customer details in total), with financing records broken down by dealerships and 20 audio recordings of customers agreeing to auto loans or refinancing of auto loans. These consent calls were the customers agreeing that they understood they were getting an auto loan, confirming that the information was correct and true. They included the customer&rsquo;s name, date of birth, social security numbers, and phone numbers. These calls were in both English and Spanish.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""//static.mackeepersecurity.com/image/upload/tmp_e719718fd28bbf81d30b0542ef6ede2a.png"" style=""height:463px; width:700px"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">A member of Kromtech Security Research called and spoke with an IT administrator who looked at the url of the publically accessible data and confirmed that it appeared to belong to Alliance Direct Lending. When searching online for Alliance Direct Lending it appears that they really do &nbsp;have a solid reputation and nearly all of the reviews are positive, but data breaches can and do happen. This is yet another wake up call for anyone dealing with financial data, social security numbers, or other sensitive data to audit your data often. One simple misconfiguration could allow your entire organization&#39;s data storage publically available online to anyone looking for it. &nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Did anyone else see this data?</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">It is unclear if anyone other than security researchers accessed it or how long the data was exposed. According to the bucket properties, it was last modified on Dec 29, 2016. It contained 210 public items and 790 private ones (not available but listed) - logs. The IT Administrator claimed that it had only recently been leaked and was not was not up for long. He thanked us for the notification and the data was secured very shortly after the notification call.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The danger of this information being leaked is that cyber criminals would have enough to engage in identity theft, obtain credit cards, or even file a false tax return. Alliance Direct Lending is based in California where the law requires notification of a breach when a California resident&#39;s unencrypted personal information is compromised. California was the first state in the U.S. to require notification of security breaches (its law became effective in 2003)</p>

Experts believe that the use of medical data will change the future of healthcare, while others say that it already has. In the last decade there has been many advances in the technology to collect and generate patient and medical data. Doctors and hospitals now collect almost everything they do. The medical industry uses &nbsp;technology at every stage of patient care to analyze and understand it. Medical Big Data is supposed to help providers become more efficient and productive (and make more money from patients and insurance providers). What happens when that medical data is publically exposed?</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Medical data is also valuable asset in the hands of hackers and malicious actors who sell it or give away for free. As Dissent from Databreaches.net reported recently, the infamous TheDarkOverlord hacker dumped three more patient databases just in the first week of May!</p>

<p>During regular security audit of exposed rsync protocols on Shodan the Kromtech Security Center discovered a misconfigured backup device that appeared to contain complete medical records of potentially thousands and thousands (if not millions!) patients of Bronx Lebanon Hospital Center (BLHC).

<p>The details are mind blowing at just how much personal medical information is included in some patient files. Just one &ldquo;addiction intake&rdquo; file that researchers reviewed painted a full picture of the patient&#39;s drug use, medical history and suicidal thoughts and many other data points that the average person would never even consider. For example, there were more than 300 *txt files listed in just one directory. The size of each file ranges from 4MB to 473MB and an average 34MB text file contained the medical data for more than 7 thousand patients.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""//static.mackeepersecurity.com/image/upload/tmp_2a847144ab4a4706741c79f7c3514dd4.png"" style=""height:560px; width:580px"" /></p>

<p>So there is potentially a massive number of patient data files that were publicly exposed, not encrypted, and required no authentication to access. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Even the most modest estimate of patients affected could be as high as several million. The data includes everything, from address, SSN, email, phone, full medical diagnosis, and much more. Exposed folders contained hundreds and thousand of files in *.txt or *.pdf formats with complete personal info and medical diagnosis. Although, iHealth Innovations has a wide range of customers across the spectrum, it appears that a majority of these files originated from Bronx Lebanon Hospital Center (BLHC).</p>

<p>Most health care providers must follow the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule (Privacy Rule), a federal privacy law that sets a baseline of protection for certain individually identifiable health information (&ldquo;health information&rdquo;).</p>

<p>It is unclear if anyone else had access to these medical records and other personal data as we are still waiting for iHealth and BLHC official statements.</p>

<p>However, all parties involved are required to notify patients under the the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule, 45 CFR &sect;&sect; 164.400-414. This requires all HIPAA covered entities and their business associates to provide notification following a breach of unsecured protected health information. Similar breach notification provisions implemented and enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), apply to vendors of personal health records and their third party service providers, pursuant to section 13407 of the HITECH Act.</p>

<p>Kromtech &nbsp;Security Researchers discover a massive trove of data from U.S. businesses and investors that were connected to the peer-to-peer lender Funding Circle. Funding Circle allows investors to lend money directly to small and medium-sized businesses. As of February 2017, UK based Funding Circle has facilitated over $3.2 Billion Dollars (&pound;2.5 billion) in loans to small and medium-sized firms. Funding Circle operates in the U.K., the U.S., Germany and the Netherlands, and globally it has helped 25,000 businesses get loans and 60,000 investors.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Kromtech Researchers discovered the misconfigured Apache Hive database while conducting a security audit using public Shodan API and immediately knew that it contained financial information based on the file names and content.</p>

<p>А member of the Kromtech Security Research team alerted Funding Circle&rsquo;s information security specialist who confirmed the discovery and quickly isolated the 8 IP addresses from any external access. We can confirm that the data has been taken offline and is no longer publically available. Their log analysis indicates that there was no other access of the data by a third-party other than by our team.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The database was structured to include private data sets from 3rd parties and credit agencies such as Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Experian, Powerlytics, as well as personal and enterprise information originating from a Funding Circle sub-servicer in the U.S. These companies provide data on companies and individuals to help businesses target new customers</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The exposed database was isolated to Funding Circle&rsquo;s U.S. business and contained no data from other markets in which Funding Circle operates. Among the sensitive data discovered included:</p>

<ul>
	<li>5,974 U.S. business owners SSN and 3,946 EIN numbers,&nbsp;credit scores, and business loan histories</li>
	<li>Millions of U.S. business names, business addresses and contact details, and CEO/business owners&rsquo; name and professional details</li>
	<li>More than 13 million marketing email addresses with the contacts of decision-makers inside U.S. businesses and gov&#39;t organizations.</li>
	<li>More than 45 thousand internal notes that summarize customer updates or conversations from loan servicing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yet another wakeup call for lending institutions to audit their data storage practices. Due to its specifics, Apache Hive architecture is widely used for analysis of the large datasets stored in different repositories (such as Hadoop HDFS and Amazon AWS) and in some cases, if you can access the host/port over the network, you can access the data. According to Shodan reports, only in the US there are more than 600 indexable instances of Apache Hive, with more than 1,100 servers worldwide.</p>

<p>This is why it&#39;s important to follow the golden rules of &#39;cyber hygiene&#39;: you need to continuously check (ping) your &#39;internal&#39; IP from the external environment. And, of course, don&#39;t forget to put a password on a backup device.</p>

<p>Researchers were able to identify the connection to Funding Circle by information in the internal notes that were also stored on the server. Researchers sent the breach notification and Funding Circle the US confirmed that the data was in fact theirs. With at least 8 unique IP addresses exposing data, they were shocked to learn of the potential breach and have since secured the data.</p>

<p>Is rare for companies or organizations to be thankful or acknowledge a data breach. However, they thanked the research team for reporting the misconfiguration and were fast and professional in their response and action.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">We would like to add to the story an official statement from Funding Circle:</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">&ldquo;A security researcher informed us of a vulnerability in one of our databases. As soon as we learned of the issue, we launched a full investigation, determined the cause, and immediately implemented a fix. Our log analysis highlights that there was no other access of this data by a third party other than the security researcher. We are grateful to him for bringing this to our attention and are currently conducting a full analysis with third-party support to ensure independent verification of our findings.</p>

<p>During our research we were surprised to see as many as 313 large databases, with size over 1GB, with several terabytes of data, hosted in US, Canada and Australia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The database in question is hosted on a cloud-based IP, and it is unclear who actually owns it. We sent notification email to the hosting provider, but usually it is not the quickest way to shut it down.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">After a series of &lsquo;ransomware&rsquo; attacks targeted on MongoDBs left without authorization in the beginning of this year, I was not sure if somebody still uses early versions of Mongo where default configuration is possible. It appears that &ldquo;Eddie&rdquo; did.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The lesson here is simple: most likely, your password is already there and somebody might be trying to use this just now. So isn&#39;t that a good time to change it now?</p>

","Offline Criminals Now Targeting Car Owners, Stealing Cars Using Online Data and Cloned VIN Numbers. ",,"<p dir=""ltr"">Kromtech Security Researchers have discovered a unprotected database of what appears to be a collection of marketing data from big and small US-based auto dealerships.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Carefully compiled database contains information of 10 million car owners all over the US. Information is structured in the way that enables anybody to have access to three sets of data - customer details, vehicle details and sales details. The customer details include personal information such as their full name, address, mobile/home/work phones, email, birth date, gender, and children over 12 years old. The vehicle details include Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), model, model year, sales rep name, mileage. Sales details include VIN, mileage odometer, sales gross, pay type, monthly payment amount, purchase price, payment type (cash, bank, card).</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>The Real Threat: Criminals Now Using VINs To Steal Cars or Commit Fraud &nbsp;</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Sophisticated criminals have now created a way to combine traditional offline crimes like stealing cars and technology. Criminals are now using leaked or hacked data to obtain unique identifiers for a vehicle and then &ldquo;cloning&rdquo; a VIN to make a stolen car appear to be perfectly legal. The car&#39;s vehicle identification number (VIN) is the identifying code for a single automobile and is unique to that specific vehicle. This leak is a warning notice to Auto Dealerships to do more to protect not just their customer data, but also details about the cars they sell.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The criminals chose the make, model of the car they want to steal, then they use the database of VIN numbers to make a new VIN plate and obtain a fake title. Once the criminals have the stolen car and the real VIN number from the database they can then sell the car to an unsuspecting buyer. The victim may not realize right away that the car is stolen until the criminals are long gone with the money and there is no chance to get it back. &nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">It was reported on June 1st that the Hooligans biker gang have been charged in connection with a string of Jeep Wrangler thefts that police say totaled $4.5 million worth of vehicles stolen.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The database seen by Kromtech researchers includes <strong>16522</strong> Jeep Wranglers with unique VINs.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">According to the <a href=""https://theoutline.com/post/1619/a-biker-gang-used-a-hacked-database-to-steal-150-jeeps"">article</a> the gang used a hacked database to duplicate Vehicle Identification Numbers also known as VIN numbers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Using a compromised database of VINs for Jeep Wranglers, these bikers were able to create duplicate keys to gain access to the Jeeps they targeted. It&rsquo;s unclear how the Hooligans got access to this database of VINs.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Carfax the web-based service that supplies vehicle history reports had warned in late 2015 that a VIN Cloning scam is sweeping the country and costing consumers tens of thousands of dollars and leaving them without the cars they thought they had paid for.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">With such a large number of automobile VINs exposed researchers are warning car dealerships to take every possible measure to secure their data. Cyber criminals are becoming more creative by the day and to see the crossover from online crime to stealing cars is a disturbing trend.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The database has been online for more than 137 days now. Security Researchers have yet to identify the owner of the database and asking for anyone from the exposed dealerships or the potential owner to contact us.</p>

The data appears to be a PC backup apparently belonging to one of the company&rsquo;s VPs and stored on an unprotected Amazon bucket dating from 2004-2008 and with clients such as EMI, Sony Pictures, Comcast, NBC Universal, and other top names it is clear to see just how sensitive this data could be. &nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is object storage designed to store and access any type of data over the Internet and in general It is very secure. S3 is used for backup and recovery, tiered archive, photos, videos, music and files, &ldquo;Big Data&rdquo; analytics, data warehouse platforms, and just about anything else you can imagine. Unsecured Amazon s3 buckets are not something that is improperly configured by Amazon. No, by default all the content and files within a bucket are not accessible from the external environment. However, as far as our security audits show, there are way too many companies, individuals, organizations, and governmental agencies for some unknown reason purposely disable the security preferences on their cloud services. Once Amazon&rsquo;s default security is disabled the data then becomes available for public access.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Rightsline is marketed as an advanced content management system (CMS) that helps intellectual property owners manage their contacts, projects, catalogs, deals, inventory, and accounting. It is sold as a software and a service for rights and contract management. The concept of the platform is to make more money by using technology to streamline the complex part of the entertainment industry. In short the platform helps intellectual property owners manage things like contracts and licensing of shows, seasons, films, albums, songs, and content distribution.</p>

<h3 dir=""ltr"">Security and Confidentiality</h3>

<p dir=""ltr"">&ldquo;Rightsline leverages the most secure data protection mechanisms available in the market to ensure that your data always remains your data.&rdquo; - from the Rightsline website</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The danger of any data breach or leak is often the human factor. In this case a company does everything right and takes the necessary precautions only to have a senior executive leave a backup drive exposed. The backup contained a massive amount of information on clients, payments, and included 2GB of backed up email correspondence. Many of the files say &ldquo;Privileged and Confidential&rdquo; and it is a unique look into the world of the music and entertainment business.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The list contains some of the biggest names in music and some of the most beloved songs ever written. What is most interesting is to see the cost of including music in TV, films, and commercials. It is jaw dropping to see some of the totals on these spread sheets. This information is usually kept private for a number of reasons, but seeing the breakdown helps you understand the massive amount of money, who it is going to, and where the music will be used, etc.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">In June 2014 Critical Mass Studios Inc acquired RightsLine Software. At the time RightsLine was already being used to track more than 65,000 contracts across the entertainment industry by studios and major publishers such as NBCUniversal, Snagfilms, MGM and Samuel French. Although this data goes back to before Critical Mass Studios Inc purchased Rightsline they were already established and working with some big brands and all of that information was publically available online.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The data even contained screenshots of royalty tracking and accounting info for Toy Giant Mattel&rsquo;s Barbie accessories orders in WalMart and totaled in the millions of dollars.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Kromtech Security Researchers also discovered an unencrypted spreadsheet of remote access logins for their server, production database and more than enough credentials for anyone to access their system. It is unclear if any of the admin credentials are still valid or if anyone other than security researchers gained access to the data. One of the biggest discoveries in the repository is the massive email backup containing over 2GB of confidential correspondence.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Exposed bucket was quickly secured after notifying the company on June 12, however, no feedback was ever received. It is also unknown for how long it was open for public access and who else might have downloaded the data.</p>

Keeping medical data and hospital networks safe from unauthorized access is one of the biggest security threats facing the industry.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">In the beginning of June, the Kromtech Security Research Center has discovered a database that appears to belong to an Ohio based medical billing provider iMAX. The data was publicly available and contained patient information, login details, and more. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">iMAX provides electronic medical billing services and charges between 5% and 7% of the provider&rsquo;s net revenue from insurance and patient payments. According to their website &ldquo;iMAX Medical Billing will turn your Cash Crunch to Cash Flow through: Medical Billing, Electronic Medical Records, Collections, Automatic Checking &amp; Credit Card Payment Processing, Certified Code Review, Credentialing, and Medicare RAC Audit protection services.&rdquo; They also offer a cloud based data management solutions for &nbsp;Electronic Health Records, Patient Portal, Practice Management, and Clearinghouse. &nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The leak appears to affect 23 several different doctor&rsquo;s offices and includes&nbsp;medical history information, payment data and most importantly - <strong>login details to the online medical services, insurance portals and emails.</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">On June 12th, we have sent notification emails to the iMax persons (whose details were also exposed in the backup) and within couple of hours the IP was secured. Throughout the course of our investigation we have been in touch with Dissent Doe of databreaches.net, you can read her take on the story here:</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""https://www.databreaches.net/medical-billing-firm-exposes-unencrypted-protected-health-information"" rel=""noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">https://www.databreaches.net/medical-billing-firm-exposes-unencrypted-protected-health-information</a></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Data breaches have a lasting impact and it is estimated that they are costing the healthcare industry $6 billion annually. The Ponemon Institute conducted a benchmark study on healthcare privacy and security estimate that the average economic impact of data breaches per organization is $2.1 million. In the US medical data is protected by The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act also known as HIPAA. The law broadly applies to health care providers, data processors, pharmacies and other entities that come into contact with medical information. Under federal law, all medical related security incidents need to be reported in the event of a data breach. HIPAA also contains a Security Breach Notification Rule which requires notice of a breach of protected health information. Organizations who fail to disclose or report data breaches put their customers at risk and could potentially be breaking the law. .</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Medical billing records insurance information are the top stolen data targets</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Medical data is extremely valuable to everyone including criminals. In 2015 the medical billing outsourcing market was valued at $6.3 billion USD and is expected to grow to $16.9 billion USD by 2024 according to a report by Grand View Research. As the market grow so does the reliance for on-demand medical records and cloud based record management. It is also clear that there is no universal standard for medical data security. The patchwork of so many different medical billing providers, using different methods of storage increases the chances that some providers will use little or no cyber security methods to protect medical data. This could potentially leave millions of patient&#39;s personal information vulnerable.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">It is unclear how long the iMAX data was publicly exposed or who else except security researchers had access. This is yet another warning to any company or service provider that handles and stores personal medical data. Security experts warn that not only should they audit their security processes regularly, but they should also have an incident response process in the event of a data leak. With the wave of ransomware attacks on hospitals, and medical providers it is clear that the healthcare sector is being targeted by cyber criminals.</p>

<br />
According to DMP&rsquo;s website they are a &ldquo;Print and Direct Mail House, we specializing in litho prints, digital prints, and data services including bespoke data processing, data capture, and database management&rdquo;.<br />
<br />
Among other data, DMP stored in exposed MongoDB instance 31 thousands records including admin login details for that particular database. Once anyone had this information they could obtain highly sensitive health information such as name, date of birth, NIN number, address, investment data, and more. The combination of exposed UK NI (national insurance) numbers and investment holdings together in one place with such a complete customer profile makes this discovery a very serious breach. This is extremely sensitive data that should never be available to anyone except for trusted health professionals or financial advisors. To have this data openly available is a nightmare for any person or company. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
The problem was once again a MongoDB database was exposed with the port open as a result of a manufacturer&#39;s firewall firmware flaw. The real danger to citizens is having cyber criminals use their data for fraud, extortion or other online crimes by using their private data. The danger for any company using an exposed MongoDB is losing the data to &ldquo;Ransomware&rdquo;. As many in the cyber security world may remember the infamous MongoDB ransomware that locked the data of tens of thousands of misconfigured MongoDB databases back in 2016. It affected nearly 1/3rd of all misconfigured databases and had spread to nearly 16,000 in just 2 days. In that instance the attackers wiped out data and demanded up to one bitcoin to return it. This attack forced users to decide whether to pay the ransom money to gain control of their computers or face losing their data. DMP is lucky this was discovered by Kromtech Security Researchers and not cyber criminals who could use this data for fraud or other crimes.</p>

<p>Researchers immediately reported the issue and it was resolved within a matter of minutes after the notice was sent. It is worth noting that it is rare to have such a prompt and efficient incident response from affected company.<br />

DMP also provided us with the following statement.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;On 4 July we were made aware of a security vulnerability by a security research company which were able to access data. The vulnerability involved a single server. Immediately after this was reported, we secured the server. We have been advised by the company that the data accessed has been destroyed and there is no evidence of any further access attempts. A full review of security is now underway&rdquo;<br />
<br />
This is just another wakeup call for any data service provider big or small to take the time to test remote or public access and insure that only those who should access the files are the only ones with access. In the age of data being your business it is more important than ever to know and implement the most current cyber security methods available.&nbsp;</p>

Although wrestling is their primary focus they also earn revenue from films, music, video games, product licensing, direct product sales, and more.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">This Week Security Researchers from Kromtech discovered two open and publically accessible Amazon S3 Buckets that contained massive trove of information collected by third parties agencies specifically for WWE marketing purposes. We estimate that around 12 percent of all the information (several gigabytes) was set to &ldquo;Public&rdquo; access and available for anybody with internet connection to view and download.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">First of the unsecured Amazon S3 bucket contained a big grouping of emails in txt files. The data were from 2014-15 and contain fans names, email, physical address and results of demographic survey of their fans by asking education, age and race, childrens age and childrens gender. The total count of records was 3,065,805 and researchers checked to see if there were duplicates and in the sampling it appears that they were all unique.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Data fields for 3M+ records:</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">action|wweuid|email|address1|address2|city|region|zipcode|countrycode|firstname|lastname|mi|gender|dob|source|source2|phone|title|favstar1|favstar2|favstar3|ethnicity|education|income|newsletterPref|childrens age|childrens gender|cableprovider|adddate|network sub|profile status<br />

<p dir=""ltr"">Despite all of the scripts and arguably staged matches they have a massive fanbase and following. WWE is watched by 15 million fans each week in the United State alone and in 2016 they announced that they are expanding into China giving them a potential new fanbase of 1.4 Billion!</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">One of the archives stored with public access also included configuration file with another WWE related bucket name.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><img alt="""" src=""//static.mackeepersecurity.com/image/upload/tmp_77ab441b5c5d33a5dac7e867bc8c9330.png"" style=""height:406px; width:900px"" />The second bucket was also partially (around 12-15 percent of data) set for public access and contained another giant portion of marketing and customer data, including billing details (addresses, user names etc) of several hundreds thousands European customers from 2016.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><img alt="""" src=""//static.mackeepersecurity.com/image/upload/tmp_77ab441b5c5d33a5dac7e867bc8c9330.png"" style=""height:406px; width:900px"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The documents also included spreadsheets with social media tracking of the WWE social media accounts, like YouTube with weekly totals of plays likes, shares, comments and a more indepth look at how they manage their social media and gauge fan interactions. The list was even broken down by country so one would imagine that they can better target their ads or localized content.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Also found was a large cache of Twitter posts, saved as search results for specified keywords related to WWE.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Big entertainment companies never share that kind of stuff publicly so it is a rare view into how the WWE uses big data to understand their fanbase and the content they produce.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Both buckets were secured within a couple of hours after we sent notification messages to the emails of the WWE Corp developers found in the first bucket. However, no answer or feedback was received as of for how long these data were exposed, how many customers had their info exposed, and how many IP addresses may have accessed the database by now.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Despite being a global entertainment organization, very little is known about the behind the scenes inner workings of the privately held company. According to some estimates the WWE is valued worth is as much as $4 Billion. Many of the folders were protected and did not allow external access. No information on the wrestlers or staff was accessible, but the leak of fan emails, names and other data is a cyber security wake up call.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">This news comes on the heels of a series of hacks involving the WWE Divas&rsquo; leaked nude photos and even a sex tape scandal involving British superstar Paige. Also hacked were WWE star Maryse, Victoria, and Alexia Bliss. &nbsp;</p>

The data originated from KS Enterprises Limited a UK based money transfer service that focuses on sending money to Bangladesh. ,,"<p dir=""ltr"">Kromtech Security Researchers have discovered a publically available Amazon S3 storage bucket that contained information appearing to belong to a money transfer service. The data originated from KS Enterprises Limited a UK based money transfer service that focuses on sending money to Bangladesh.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">According to their website they were established in 2002 with the aim to provide money transfer services to the estimated 600,000 Bangladeshi people living in the UK. KS Enterprises Limited (KSEL)&nbsp;also claims to have made 3.5 million transactions last year.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The data were simply hosted under company domain abbreviation name &#39;<em>ksel</em>&#39; and&nbsp;contained sensitive and personal information that could be used by criminals for fraudulent activities. The files that researchers discovered were customer docs - passports/ proof of address documents like bills including tax bills, loan documents &nbsp;/ driver&#39;s license etc.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The total number of exposed customer accounts was more than 11,000. There were also many internal resource files or affiliate&nbsp;documents. &nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><img alt="""" src=""//static.mackeepersecurity.com/image/upload/tmp_1432a37f99170b0bb2b005a109f044ca.png"" style=""height:328px; width:395px"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><em>File Breakdown of KSEL&rsquo;s misconfigured database</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;KSEL has built up a large and comparatively faster money transfer network with the assistance of Bangladeshi private banks namely Uttara Bank Limited, Al Arafah Islami Bank and AB Bank Ltd. KSEL has now become a trusted name in the Bangladeshi community in UK for money remittance services.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">How to follow the money? There is no official mechanism for recording remittances to and from the UK.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">However, we did not find any evidence of wrongdoing by KS Enterprises Limited or any of the many affiliate data that was publicly leaked online.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><img alt="""" src=""//static.mackeepersecurity.com/image/upload/tmp_1432a37f99170b0bb2b005a109f044ca.jpg"" style=""height:302px; width:400px"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">We discovered the S3 bucket on the first week of July and&nbsp;sent notifications via email twice&nbsp;- Jul 11 and Jul 12, both times followed by a phone call but only after a week repository has been secured, without any word from the business.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">It is unclear how long the data was available or who else may have had access to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We reached out to ICO and FCA and KSEL on that case. This post will be updated as soon as we know more.</p>

<p>An&nbsp;ICO&nbsp;spokesperson said: &ldquo;Organisations have a duty to keep people&rsquo;s personal data safe and secure and must take appropriate measures to do that, whether they are storing it in paper files, on hard drives or in cloud-based systems.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;We have been made aware of an incident involving KS Enterprises and are making enquiries.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Bob Diachenko, Chief Security Communications Officer at Kromtech: &quot;Under UK law known as the Data Protection Act, companies are required to send Notification of data security breaches to the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office (ICO) and inform the thousands of customers who had their data leaked and keep a breach log.&quot;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Alex Kernishniuk, VP of strategic alliances at Kromtech: &quot;The breach is highly sensitive and with passport scans, banking info, and more it is very high risk that could adversely affect customers&rsquo; privacy. The danger of having publicly accessible AWS buckets is huge for any businesses, small or large, so it is important for anybody working with digital assets to follow simple cyber hygiene rules&quot;.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">In this instance Kromtech Security Center researchers discovered a misconfigured Amazon S3 bucket&nbsp;that was not password protected, leaving thousands of Indian citizens vulnerable. It is unclear how long the misconfigured data was publically available or who else had access to it.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The availability of open Amazon S3 buckets makes them very easy to access. So, in this particular case, if you know the address&nbsp;you can view, download and even edit the files directly in your browser. No need to install additional clients or use sophisticated techniques.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By default, S3 buckets are set to the private access. However, for some reasons (perhaps, for easy sharing purposes internally) IT managers sometime manually set it to public access.</p>

<p><br />
Bob Diachenko, chief security communications officer at Kromtech Security Center: &quot;I<em>n order to protect your S3 data from loss and unauthorized access, each company and individual using Amazon cloud infrastructure must ensure there aren&#39;t any publicly accessible S3 buckets available in account &nbsp;A publicly accessible S3 bucket allows full control access to everyone (i.e. anonymous users) to list (read) the objects within the bucket, upload/delete (write) objects, view object permissions and edit) object permissions</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;<em>We at Kromtech Security Center strongly recommend against using all these permissions for the &ldquo;Everyone&rdquo; ACL predefined group in production</em>&quot;.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">We all know that you need a good credit score to obtain loans and get the best interest rates, but what if that data is leaked online? To obtain a credit report or monitor someone&rsquo;s soore they must provide the same personal data that a criminal would need to engage in identity theft or other cyber crimes.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Any company or service that deals with sensitive customer data must take every precaution to protect customer data and how they store it.</p>

<p>Estimated number of customers who had their scanned data exposed&nbsp;is around 48 thousands.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><img alt="""" src=""//static.mackeepersecurity.com/image/upload/tmp_5acfb0a412b9947d2305c4dbf0d07da2.png"" style=""height:269px; width:333px"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">According to their website: &ldquo;Data Security - Our expert Information Security team helps to improve network Infrastructure quality. Completely secured Data - Secured Data on ISO 27001 compliant, world class data network infrastructure. Highly secured - Bank level data security with 128 Bit encryption on all transactional data&rdquo;. However, researchers were able to see thousands of scanned ID&nbsp;cards, home addresses, credit reports, accounts, and even pictures of customers. &nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Some of the folders contain a substantial number of private files:</p>

",,"<p dir=""ltr"">Discounts online have made their way into our everyday lives and we have all searched for cheap hotels, flights, or rental cars. One can find just about any niche discount service with a few keywords, clicks, and your favorite search engine. Although there are many companies that offer discount deals and broker savings between companies and customers, very little is known about exactly how these companies negotiate for the customers?</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Kromtech Security Researchers have discovered a database that appeared&nbsp;to be associated with the automated online group hotel room booking service Groupize.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Publicly accessible bucket was hosted under &#39;prm-production&#39; domain on AWS. No logins or passwords were required to access the data.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The Boston based company serves as a broker between the hotel and guests or businesses that need multiple rooms at the same time. The database contained many hotel documents including service agreements, earnings and details about their commissions. Researchers were able to see exactly how the discount hotel business model works in detail. Despite the discovery Groupize denied that any sensitive information was exposed.</p>

<p>There was evidence that appeared to connect the data with Groupize (even the name of the bucket referred to their Pipeline Response Manager system - <a href=""http://www.groupizeprm.com/"">http://www.groupizeprm.com/</a>),so the first breach notification was sent on August 9th. The following day I reached their corporate office by phone for comment and was told that &ldquo;They do use Amazon, but nothing sensitive was there&rdquo;. The employee would not transfer the call to the IT Administrator or any senior management, and offered to only take a message. Ironically, the data was secured shortly after with no comment or replies, on Aug 15th.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">This could imply that the data discovered was in fact associated with Groupize.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Here is what researchers were able to see:</p>

<ul>
	<li dir=""ltr"">
	<p dir=""ltr"">A folder named &ldquo;Documents&rdquo; contained 2,936 scans or PDFs of contracts or agreements between hotels, customers and Groupize, including credit cards&rsquo; payment authorization forms, with full CC#, expiration date and CVV code.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir=""ltr"">
	<p dir=""ltr"">A folder named &quot;all_leads&quot; contained 3,188 spreadsheets. In a single random sampling there was a total of $12.6 Million in just one spreadsheet.</p>
	</li>
	<li dir=""ltr"">
	<p dir=""ltr"">Folders titled WhiteLabel / attachments contained 32,695 files in 37 folders ( these are menus, images and more)</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>How Does It Work?</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Basically Groupize collects data from online of people looking for help with accommodations for large events and multiple bookings. Once they have an interested client they can negotiate with the hotel or venue to get a discounted rate, affiliate fee or compensation in a specific area. They charge the clients on the frontend for their services and then the hotel also pays them a percentage. Included the many documents discovered were contracts of service between Groupize and their business customers who used their services for weddings, funerals, and a host of other events. Some of these contain сredit сard numbers and other sensitive information that could be used by cyber criminals for theft or fraud. It is unclear how long the data was publically available or who other that security researchers might have accessed the files.</p>

<p>It is always interesting to see behind the doors of how a company or an industry works or operates, but the dangers of criminals obtaining this information can put the entire business at risk. Even if the data is not protected trade secrets or revolutionary new technology, it can harm your customers, and your business if the data is compromised by the wrong individuals.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">This is another wakeup call for businesses to protect their own data and the data of their customers. Technology makes it easier than ever before to collect and manage data, but without the proper security measures it is an accident waiting to happen. &nbsp;</p>

The breach has exposed a treasure trove of client information, revenue, royalties and more. Founded in 2000 by Eddie &amp; June Bell, Pat Lomax and Paul Moreton, the Bell Lomax Agency is based in London, this is small but prestigious literary agency which represents a wide range of distinguished authors and illustrators, writing and illustrating adult fiction, non-fiction and children&rsquo;s books.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">One of their most notable authors is Michael Dobbs who not only wrote a series of novels about Winston Churchill, but also wrote <strong>House of Cards</strong>. The novel became a hit show as an American political drama in a Netflix series of the same name. Included in the backup is an &ldquo;revised version&rdquo; in a simple word document. &nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""//static.mackeepersecurity.com/image/upload/tmp_d4f3070ebf89d7e592263d9073715e3f.png"" style=""height:477px; width:624px"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The publisher has accidentally exposed its backup device to the public internet. The Rsync (remote synchronization protocol) was misconfigured with no security protections and this could allow anyone with internet access to see their most sensitive data. Kromtech Researchers were able to access thousands of documents, including Bell Lomax Agency&rsquo;s Quickbooks accounting files, archive email boxes, financial data, expenses, administrative details, royalties and client details for 2014-2015.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>The Danger of Leaking Your Entire Business Online</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Kromtech Security Center experts issued several community warnings in the past alerting about the dangers of having non-protected Rsync protocols in place, but this problem still happens far too often.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Bob Diachenko, chief security communication officer at Kromtech Security Center:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p dir=""ltr"">This breach&nbsp;is once again another reminder that all companies who manage sensitive data must do more to protect their files, customers, or intellectual property stored online. There are serious potential threats from cyber criminals who can access sensitive data. These range from extortion to identity fraud, and other cyber crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p dir=""ltr"">Researchers identified that the files were visible via open port 873 which allowed anyone with an internet connection to connect with a command-line utility. IT Administrators can easily restrict who has permissions or access, but far too often they leave the remote synchronization protocol unprotected or with a public setting. It is imperative that companies and organizations both large and small have a security review processes or cyber security audit in place to ensure security gaps are identified and closed immediately. &nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Alex Kernishniuk, VP of strategic alliances at Kromtech, commented on the breach</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir=""ltr"">There has never been a greater public awareness of data protection and it seems like almost daily there is yet another reminder. As the last few years have shown us the threats only increase and security professionals must adapt fast to new emerging threats. Unlike the scripted drama in The House of Cards, the danger online is real. Misconfigured backups are a serious issue could severely damage a company&rsquo;s business, customers, employees or partners. If you or your company use an Rsync protocol, take the time to review the security configuration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p dir=""ltr"">After contacting the agency on August 29, backup device was secured. Paul Moreton commented with the following statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir=""ltr"">We are grateful to Kromtech Security for pointing out a flaw in the security of our back up files. We recently moved to offsite back up but will now return to backing up onsite only. We have disabled the offsite back up with immediate effect.</p>
